I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
No.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Like you care.
But you hate Joey
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
What if she never starts dating?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, no!
No, but
So they tell me...
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Don't make me do it, man
You get the girl.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Why 're you doing this?
Why?
Dorsey.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Were you in jail?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Because I like to torture you.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Because you're making decisions for me.
Parts of it.
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Kat a fan, too?
What?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
We're your guys.
With the teeth of your zipper?
But -- who -- what --?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
That's something you can't decide.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Thousands.
You did the same to your God!
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
God be with us admiral.
Six days ago, yes.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
No.
No.
I know.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
I'll make some for us.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
A timer.
I don't even watch TV.
Pretty.
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Better than one.
So am I.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
You're not so bad yourself.
Answer it.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Okay.  You ready?
Yes sir.
How long are you planning to stay?
How you erase this?
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Did you hurt her?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Yes, the money is good.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
What are you coming here to do?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Aren't you tired?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Yes.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
That's true.
You're kidding.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Roger.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Are you coming to my party?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Thank you.
Really?
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Roger.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Luther was part of the gang?
Want to try it again?
You have a good time?
That's never been one of my problems.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Must be billy's girl.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
What?
What'd you do?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack?  What was that?
Hiya, kid.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Where is he?
That's no bull.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Five.  On credit.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
That's what I thought.
When is she not in trouble?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Have you pulled yourself together?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
It's like a cab isn't it?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoussan!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You noticed..
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Because...
Talk English Doc.
Wait or act.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Why the gun?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I don't know what to say
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
What are you talking about?
I promised him to Machine.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
Where are the women?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
I told you, I don't know.
It was a lot of fucking money.
Tell me what happened.
Stop talking.
Easy enough for you.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
I'm listening.
You are a private investigator?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
They're no friends of mine.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Snuff films.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Specialty product.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
The checks were for odd amounts...
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
That's exactly what I am.
We're all like that.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Who are you?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
It was bad.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Who?
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
How did you know that?
She doesn't want me around
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Me too.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
That's their problem.
Yeah...
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
What???
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What direction does the system indicate?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?
Minus three.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Who?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yes.
Oh.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You think so.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Really.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Yeah.
Sun's gettin high.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Not here.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Do what?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
What do you want, then?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Yeah, lots.
Did you get his number?
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
When did she die?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Bang!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Well, it was an accident.
Yeah, I guess.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Yeah.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I'm sorry, honey.
Your father never means to be so...
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
I know he left you behind.
Yes
How can you? I mean they're people.
That was war.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
I wish it were that easy...
We're under attack.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Twenty-five years.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Not now, Elaine.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
I'm so excited, Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to hear that word!
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
That's right.
A hospital? What is it?
Well...
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
I love you, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
What is it?
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Would you go up, please?
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Did you learn anything?
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
At the end of the bar.
This is mole.  It's good.
When will Strader return?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Fuck procedure.
Tell me about it...
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Corporal Hicks!?
Sorry to disappoint you.
Dead on all channels.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Uh, what's next?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
No.. I've slept enough.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Sweet Jesus.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Where?
In a harem.
A brothel.
The marriage!
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
I'll be right back.
No, she's fine.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Yes!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Yes!
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
What does she want?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Oh, Stanzi.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
No one.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
He's terribly busy, sir.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Oh, thank you, sir!
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
What?
I was at hand.
He needs me, ma'am.
He asked me to stay.
Adorable!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
And German?
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Enchanted, Madame.
Yes, Sire.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
I have no idea.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Why not?
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa!
Good morning, sir.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Yes.
So let me see it. Where is it?
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
I'm afraid not.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Did my work please you?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
I do.
Who?
What man?
Of course.
Consigned to flames of woe.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
You go fast!
Exactly.
But, Your Majesty -
Just let me tell you how it begins.
On the contrary.
So?
Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Is it true?
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Where?
Never mind.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
What exactly did he call out?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
Do me an enormous favor?
See you later.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
No.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Why are you doing this to me?
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
What time is it?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I don't know.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
What was it?
Heathcliffe.
Where are we going?
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
Are you going to help me up?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
Will you be quiet?!
I wanted to see you.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Send them in.
No.
I'd like some tea, please.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
What good will that do?
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Just pure luck!
What do you mean, help?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Why, of course.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Line?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
My apartment.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Why - well, I—
Where is he now?
Now don't you worry about it.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
I haven't any.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Yes, sir.
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
Don't you think I know it?
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
He's at a board meeting.
Yes.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then where were you?
I guess so.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Now you tell us.
What?
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
The Army can hang him.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
What is wrong with you?
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
It was exciting.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
I'm thinking...
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
What is it?
Such as?
I figure.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
We're gonna have to talk...
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Yeah, Jimmy?
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
What?
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
Fair enough.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
You do that.
How much did they get from the safe?
THEN WHO DID?!
It's going to be a long winter.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Uh huh.
I can't.
Eight?
This is Dorsia?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Yes?
Really?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
He's rich.
He has a great body
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I have to return some videotapes.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I won't...don't worry.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Jean? What?
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Why?
Hello 
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Well...
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
I've questioned him.
I lost my job...
I'm hungry
I'm hungry.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Yes, it is.
You know what I mean.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
...But?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
What?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's gonna get cold.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
I am. I am, sir.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Oh. No thanks.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Just do what I'm asking!
Just do it.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
...You wanna work -- here?
Let's get him in here.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I don't know --
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Oh.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Behave!
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
What's the other?
Carnies.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I'm sorry?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
How do you know?
Oh, yes you are.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Not now, Austin.
Indeed.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'll hurry back.
Austin, what's your point?
Oh, behave!
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Sure.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
What are you saying, son?
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
My son?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Right.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Great.
Did you ever want to?
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Secret ...
... love ...
Sir August...?  What now?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
After the cold war ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Ring?
Then what's stopping you?
1922. Why the kippers?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Or half cocked.
For a man in my position --
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
No thanks.
An eccentric recluse?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
I might say the same.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
As far as you trust me.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
But --
Not quite.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
You're saying I have no choice.
Global warming?
Dead, I'm afraid.
She may try to kill you.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
I think so, thank you so much ...
Perish the thought.
I do.
Ugh ...
Check out the other guy's buns.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
No.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Yes, sir.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Gonna get married...
Your mother's not dead.
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you!
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
The phone made me do it!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Who?
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Yeah...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
Not likely.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Brian, look --
Just leave me alone, okay?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
So hello.
You're selling dad's boat?
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
-- What are you doing here?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Jennifer.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Yeah...
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
I was doing my job.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Sure you do.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Pest control.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
How ya feeling?
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
I treated you better.
You can't keep being his father...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
You like everybody, Ronald.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
I might.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
Who?
You mean you could use it.
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
Me?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
Did he gots to be.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Yeah, him.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
You might be right.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
She's also moorish.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
You ain't happy about the green light?
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
And this is Manray.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Break a leg.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
That's why it will be so much fun.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
You sound like the media.
Same thing Giuliani said.
No.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
I can't go all the way down south.
Soon.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
The best defense is offense.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
To come back to our roots.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
...I heard different, thought that was...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like grits and butter...
How be dat?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
My people love me.
What?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Just ask me what you want to know.
That is none of your business.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I never was more in earnest.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
Certain?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Old fool!
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
The Prince left him only that choice.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes, he's fine.
I beg your pardon?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
We don't know. West is dead.
What do you mean, alone?
I'm not telling you what happened.
That'd be my reaction too --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
He's telling the truth up to a point...
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
If not you, then who?
His chest was hamburger --
Put it down!
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
You're drunk --
Get your hands away from the desk!
You knew Sergeant West?
That is the most unprofessional --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
But you will.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Buttfucks the cabin?
That bugs you too?
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
You mean the falsely accused?
Think it'll work?
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Get in.
Nah.
Yeah.
What?
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
What.
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
Go.
No, I understand.
Make him stop.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Did you do any of that?
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Really.
The river?
Story of my life.
Yes. Exactly.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
'Fraid so.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
There's over eighty thousand here.
No I haven't.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Tell me.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
They go.
I know you just want to punish me --
What?
What?
Okay we won't talk about it.
Sometimes which?
You are throwing me out.
Are you scared?
I'm trying to quit.
Except for Small Eyes.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Right.
Then start taking them seriously.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Don't make it less true.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Can I come in?
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
She's around. Always is.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
How long... how long I been out?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
What do you want?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
You drink whiskey?
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Why you say that?
What'chu sayin'?
Naw!
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
That's right.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Yeah, I know.
I'm a what?
Ronnie...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Why?
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
The Wolf?
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
No.
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Hey, all right.
Connie...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't, that's all.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
Yeah...
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
There she is!
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Kampai.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Tell them I'm not.
What if I chant?
Don't be.
Not in that company.
What?
I planned on catching him, Captain.
It is not allowed.
You're foreigners.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
You trust me?
Where?
Also extraordinary things.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
He could?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Thank you.
When?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Industrial refuse.
Garbage man?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
How do I stop one?
I know all that.
And what in your estimation works?
Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.
I like you too.
You sure?
But if you could?
Can I come in?
What did she want?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Me and my dad.
Yeah.
What?
Hmmm?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Thirteen.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Don't move.
What one?
What desert?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
We sure did.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Good.
Thank-Q!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Well, that depends...
Eve? I'm leaving.
No, I'm lost.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
And that's it?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Sure.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Night!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Okay.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Two weeks.
Stop that ma'am crap!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
May I please be excused?
Yeah.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Not that one!
No way.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Gerade aus dann links!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Then why go there?
Because he must!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
That's what everybody believes?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Who use to own it?
Yeah.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
The recovery is very impressive.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Just look!!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
How do you do, ma'am.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Really? No kidding?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
I'll be all right.
Mom?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
He drank it hot?
Good god.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
It's safe.
You have tranquilizers?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Hi.
Would you excuse me?
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
No.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Yes, dear, I know.
I knew you'd like him.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Those sluts!
To bed.
Yes, you do.
What?!!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Not yet.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
THEN WHAT?
Never before this.
I, I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
See my breasts? See?
See my nipples?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Then don't talk about killing.
OK.
That's good.
I'm doing it.
I want you to hurt me.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Oh he forced you, huh?
You want to see him too, right?
Speak to me Fucker.
Yes.
There ya go.
Mom.
This is it.
What?
Alright.
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
Terrible boring.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's go.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Why not?
OK.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
Actually. I've been in twice.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You like mysteries that much?
What is it?
Go ahead.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Oh fuck! 
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
What did you do, Connor?
Aye.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
Rocco!
Pee...Per...Man.
It was... It was...
Really want to know?
The fat man.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Sweet-n-low!
Roc. You okay?
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I believe these young men are right.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Open it!
Just be natural, goddamit.
He's a nigger.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
No. This is he.
Would they do that?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Hang on a second.
Just turn right here.
You think we're going to be chased?
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
What. What's the matter?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
She doesn't need to know.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
That's not correct.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Sure.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I don't think you will.
He was all right.
What?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
You got to be kidding me.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
What do you mean?
Behind Bob's house.
What?
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Death.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Let them fight.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I hope not.
Nobody does.
Why not?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
You're Anthony?
I hear you're a good thief.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
You're the faggot.
It's true, Dignan.
You're paranoid, Bob.
What did I say?
That's too bad.
What the fuck possessed you?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Jesus Christ.
And what does that cover?
Oh, yeah.
Where?
Is that your chiquita?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Never heard of it.
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
It was staged?
You're a liar.
I don't know who that is.
I'll get the book.
It's just a nightmare.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Switch! You drive!
I did.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Abbott?
Are you disappointed?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Yes. In that order.
It is suicide.
He will. I know he will.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
How many?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Thank you for inviting.
You are. And I'll come again.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
And I will consult with mine.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What is it?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Anything.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
So what did you find.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I don't know. These things take time.
Weirder than this?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
What?
Huh?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
What do you want to know, Evan?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I don't get it.
Then you think it might have worked out?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Evan Treborn.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Oh, yes.
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Goodnight.
Come up here a minute.
That's all right.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Suppose we do.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Well, so long.
And the other alternative?
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
I didn't count the days.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You can believe that if you want to.
Put them on the table.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
No, not yet.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
No, Victor, no.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
I love you very much, my dear.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
You're saying this only to make me go.
My office.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Even in Berlin.
Thank you.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Why two?
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
What friend?
Well, she isn't just any woman.
I have. Sit down over there.
You think of everything, don't you?
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Put that phone down!
-- You thought what?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Not right now.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
Get up, damn you.
Thirsty.
No water, no work.
Take it.
Fix raft first.
Die tomorrow or die today.
Yeah, sure, what?
They're on autopilot.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You?  Personally?
For when I travel?
I burned the Christmas tree.
Don't even start.
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
What was inside?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Mom, meet Jango.
I'm doing fine.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
What about the sender?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
I was making a point.
You're fucking dead!
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
I braided them.
That's all there is.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
No sweat.
They just want you to hire some new help.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Dr. Homer Wells.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
It will be okay.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
"...did." Well, okay.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
I never said they were boring.
Nobody ever wants me!
Nobody special enough, Curly.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
A B-24 Liberator.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Migrants?
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Is it true?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
I haven't read that.
It's my turn!
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
No trouble.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
That's it.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
There'll be red flags.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Like what?
After you cut her loose.
Today? Started off great...
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
And what about Big Al?
We pay better.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
No. Just confidence.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Did I miss something?
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
That was fucking deep.
I can handle it.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
That's what I'm talking about.
Sorry.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
We all played the field.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
I'll try and make it.
Who was he?
Not particularly.
It came my way. 450 a week.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
I'll watch.
I didn't.
Then you're not a pro.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
I have to take the car.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Thanks.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
It was you, you shit.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
I make it six.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I hope it's not the oven again.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Time to start talking.
Talby, can you read me?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Exactly.
So if you detonate in...
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Yes.
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
No kidding?
We're running out of time, sir.
Talk to the bomb.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Oh, yeah?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
How I make my living, what's your point?
What're you talkin' about?
Police drone.
You didn't...
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
No...
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Girl's gotta make a living.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
You got a lotta nerve.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
How well do you remember the lab?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Let go of my hand.
I understand.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
A fog bank.
Unlikely.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Really?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I'll give it my best shot.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
More like deployed in bed asleep.
For a change.
Huh?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Tickets?
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
They're what?
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Yeah, you did!
GOOD MORNING!
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
A metal craft of any kind.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Fuck them.
And you'd never been there before?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
What do you mean?
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Know what?
Grandma Death.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Why should we care?
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
What is her name?
Do you think a lot about girls?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Is Callie still around?
Yes. I went to jail.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
I think now that he might...
God exists because you're horny.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Her name is Gretchen.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You can suck a fuck.
Yep.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
What?!
C'mere. I love you so much.
Here, have some.
I know.
Okay... well, bye.
Hi.
Hi.
Loretta, shut it.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Yeah.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
And everything.  He should be king!
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I don't wanna work at all.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
Why wasn't I insulted?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Anything else? 
I can't do it right away.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
And Vera niece, too.
Was it -- swine?
That's it...
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Now -- er --
Oh, yes.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Yes?
Shut up!
He must have taken quite a fall.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Three quarters of an hour.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
What a mess.
Romance!
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Want to come out?
You're English.
Good morning.
Yes!
My... name is...
Say "Merrick".
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
You did not ask me.
The hospital?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Thank you very much.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Of course.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Yes! The workhouse!
No, he's very upset about something.
Very smart indeed.
Welcome home, John.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What d'you mean?
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
I will go and wake them up!
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well... isn't it great?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Really.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Don't talk nonsense.
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
The important thing is not to panic.
Oh, get it over with.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
What's it all about?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
You'll see!
So?
But you're the Gods!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
No! Arrgh!
Keitel Blacksmith?
But...
What is it?
Over the Edge of the World.
Please.
Well, where is he then?
Same thing, isn't it?
Your lord.
Hang on...
You could charge him what you like.
Together we stand!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You liar!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Hi.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I can't remember.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
That's okay.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I like to read.
You just say. I'm not really --
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Okay.
You'll call me, right?
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
You're not ready.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Really? Is he cute?
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Yeah.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Come up and see me... now.
Well, you're married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I think she's great.
It's dark.
What if you stay this time?
Says you were a bully...
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
It's too late.
Any messages, Carmen?
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Go back to sleep.
I'm sorry.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
It's a good one all right.
Yup.
Yeah.
You love him, don't you?
I don't know! I just said that!
Hell no.
Hi.
Then why did you ask me?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
It was a mutual decision.
She came to help, Howard.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
I don't.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
For magazines?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Hold on, Coop...
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
It is not.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
Go on.
It gets worse.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Thank you.
What's on your mind?
Some things you don't get over.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
...how's the client?
That's what we're here to find out.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
If it worked.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
It's done.
Watch me.
Then who the fuck are you?
What is that?
Yes, sir.
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Starck...
They're gone.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
What's causing the readings?
Who?
Yes.
He's been past Mars?
Can you shut it down?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
Picking up magnetic interference.
I'm trying, goddammit --
How?
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
And you can? Power it up?
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Don't you wander off, boy.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
You've been working out.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
But all these people...
Johnny.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
I gave him twenty.
Why didn't you say something?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
You want to work at Carl's?
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
First door on your left!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Why can't you do it?
They're not home yet.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Where did you hear that?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
No.
But they weren't mine.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Mark is a really nice boy...
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
How about both of us at the same time?
Hello.
I know it's yours.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Get going.
It's definitely your mama.
Yeah?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
Totally.
All right.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
It was nice.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
But what are you going to do?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I know, everyone says that.
No problem.
The point sounds fine.
You keep them.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
John Bonham?
Okay. Thanks.
Well, thank you.
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
WHAT?
What?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw! Not a major.
Really?
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
I have to go.
GO?
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
How about a check?
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Lucy.
Some of what?
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
That's a strange attitude.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
We can't risk letting them in.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Come on, come on.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Just move!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Why don't you go check it out?
Go douche.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your parents of relation?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
He's dead.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
Duh hickey.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
And the last one is the...
GO-GO-GO!!
Let's lock off this room.
What did we say about lying?
I just hit it like you said.
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Who is she?
Where's Clifford?
Right now we have to be practical.
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Showdown.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Really?
See you next weekend, Dad.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I know.
Be careful, Francie.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
See you next weekend?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Harry.
What?
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
You don't know what you want.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
You're coming.
And?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
What's that?
What a man!
Frances, You're crazy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
And no people.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Fine!
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
But I want to. I'm trying!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
...You will.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Oh bullshit.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Please sit down...
Stay calm, please.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Yeah?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
'Incurable.'
Yes.
And he drove me to mine.
People can be kinder than you think.
Kill me and have done with it.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I should go. I should leave today.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
The world is a dizzying place.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Oh God.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
I resent God's monopoly.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
I've been preoccupied.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Philosophical?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I don't believe you...
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
You? The brick?
Lead the way!
Umhummmmph.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
So do I just follow you?
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
Jacob.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Come again?
In heaven.
How'd she die?
Why'd ya quit?
You won't let him touch her?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
To yours.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Mexicans.
You asked me if I would --
You damn well better. Go.
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
Shut up and start the car.
He didn't recognize shit.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How do you know?
What?
Keep your voice down.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
You know what you look like?
My shit is together.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Just some of the women.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Who's...  Lieuten --
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Of course, but there's more --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
I'll act surprised.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Uh, question, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
I was looking for him earlier, but...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I don't know, I don't care.
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Which is guy-speak for...
Made it to Week 10 last time.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
That's a good story.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
You heard me.  Move on.
Should I be afraid?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
No.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
15, sir.
Your new roommate.
North?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
Really? I'd like to find out.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Call me Charlie.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Follow me.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
We know.
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
Makes us look more American.
It's okay. I know her.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
"Just!?"
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I played Richard III...
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
The ships are gaining...
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
Shit! Go!
It's fractured...
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Something BAD happened here.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
We're doing episode 31?
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Jason..
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
I could have held on to YOU! ...
What the hell are you talking about?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Mark 12.
You are so full of shit
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Stop, please! I don't know!
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Home.
You... You mean Earth?
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Oh god...
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Because they're coming right at us.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
It is.
The army can survive without me.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Yes, my lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Then use rocks!
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
To learn to shoot cannon?
No one knows...
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
I'm not sure.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Detained by what?
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
They help me understand why we fight.
How can you say that?
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
General Lee, sir!
My God, what?
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
It is; we need you George.
But not more than your comfort.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
They can use their imaginations.
That's good... who?
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
I mean I don't care.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Calm down, Bear...
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Not too bad.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
That's all.
In just a second. Two...
Leo, I don't know.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Whatever you want, Ray.
I'm in the movie business.
You have a card in here?
Something shouldn't be there.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Not really.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
I'm thinking of a movie.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
That's not bad.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
Here's another tip...
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Rough day on the set?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
For any movie.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
"Cotton".
Then you've read it?
And you think the movie business is any different?
You thought I was faking?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
That's where you got the idea?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Say again. Over.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
Why not.
Maureen.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Gimme a break.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
Smugglers maybe.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
What about running number two by itself?
How long, then?
Could be meant as a warning.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
There's a charming thought.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Lights?
I feel fine.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
What?
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
I don't know.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Let the buyer beware.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Fine with me.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
How should I know?
Who?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I just buzzed him in.
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Help me what?
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Jesus...
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
I guess.
Nothing.
Yeah, well --
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Why not?
Are you ready to go?
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Just look at them!
In fact, never.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I've been looking all over for this.
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
What, is she black now?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Everybody's too stupid!
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I don't believe you.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Which one?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Go ahead...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
What are you talking about? Who?
I don't believe you.
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I dunno...
It just came yesterday...
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Who does?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Norman.
Hey, where are you going?
Okay.
Hey, I was only kidding!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Just wait here.
What? Why?
No, Doofus... blow it out!
Are you okay?
Why?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What do you want?
I-I-I...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
I think it's been a pleasure.
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
Possibly.
John, it will not be easy.
That's what the books say... 
Got me out of trouble.
Somehow I guessed. 
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
The workers don't get on?
Thank you, Samuel.
You give me hope, John. 
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
I'd rather not.
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Thanks.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Let me jingle you right now.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Tonight?
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Did I forget something?
Like what?
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
You need the exercise.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Then let's do it.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Well don't think!
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
Well, thanks a lot.
What's the matter, dear?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
I got the Twister game for later ...
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
That's a violin concerto.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.
Take me now.
Talk to my accountant. 
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
I see.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Great!  How's it going?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Then my theory was correct.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Oh, shit!
Looked at with your eyes.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
No sense worrying about it now.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Well, that ought to do it.
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
LATER, MAN!!
That's what you told me two days ago!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Give away food?
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
He left us at dawn.
I'll nose around...
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
That's what worries me...
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I can see that...
I don't want you to die!
Alive... I'm alive...
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
Before they leave, get gold.
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Yes.
Are you going to graduate school?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Did they ever find out?
Yes.
Oh my God --
I've never been to it.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
What do you think?
You've got to tell me what she said.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Well -- where are you going?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Shhhh.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Because I don't like you.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
What?
What do you drink?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
My husband will be back quite late.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Then why do you keep running away?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Oh my God.
Let me out!
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Now?
Well -- I don't know.
Benjamin.
Yes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
What?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Wait a minute.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Go ahead then.
I don't remember.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Well how long has this been going on.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
But you don't hate him.
Is it?
Are you shocked?
Really. I want to know.
No.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Do exactly what I say.
Go home now.
I don't think so.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
What?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
Different.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
I know.
How long have we known each other now?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
I'd like to hear it.
Oh yes.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
But why?
Why?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'd like to discuss this.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Not with strangers.
Have you seen it?
No -- why? -- should I?
Chasing what?
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Certainly.
I want to be alone --
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
No.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Good!
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
I thought she was splendid!
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
But Doctor --
What, Doctor?
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Stay where you are.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Tired?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
...weight into the balance...
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
No -- now.
Well -- you want me?
Oh, yes.
Baron!
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
And I said we didn't.
He likes to play the great man.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
What -- what is it? Last night...
You're discharged.
We must call the police, your excellency.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
What you need is some relaxation.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Motherhood.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
What's that, Lilly?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Hah.
Right in front of the room.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
Not much time.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
So I heard.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Get off the grift, Roy.
I've really got to --
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
We'll work something out, Joe.
I can't. I just left home.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Oh, don't be stupid.
We'll rent a car.
You already went back to work.
Oh, come on, Roy.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Where?
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Open it and find out.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
I like a woman who takes control.
Care to join me?
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
No.  Wait for the police.
My office?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Nothing.
It's an option.
I can't afford to get caught.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Here, take my jacket.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
It's always John.
I have to pee.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Where's Shane?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Is Tim there?
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
I promise.
Who are you?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
God ... this can't be true.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Him.
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
It's not working!
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
Or what's left of him.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Jamie's baby ...
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
You told me.
Really?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
Out!  Out!
Thank God!
Hello.
Are you--do you--
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Dr. Woodly.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Where's Mom?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Man and boy.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Excellent!
Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Penelope!
No.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
What do you do for a living?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Say hello to your mother.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
What a honeymoon.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He cried.
Almost a Christmas scene.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Blue soup?
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Load it for her.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And her fiancé!
I've literally got to run!
I've never heard of it.
What for?
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
And terror, if you don't mind.
King Arthur.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
The new hero is you.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?
What will you do, Colonel?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
What's this?
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Stay home tonight!
I don't really know.
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
Oh?
My father!
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Far as I know.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Paul's only twelve years old.
Thanks.
Phooey.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Are you sure it's all right?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Granville?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
That's right.
Mast?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'll be there.
What have you found out?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
What's it called?
Do you think she's safe?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
What?
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
I don't know.
Where!
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
I want to meet Ratan.
Rucker.
Well...
It's a short film.
But I...
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
You ever play Chicken?
You never heard of that?
I'm worried about Jake.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Yes, I am.
Yes.
Your tree.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
A block of ice.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Eh, no.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
No.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
But this is public property.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
It's so blue.
Well, why don't you?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Oh, Harold. 
It's true. I can't live without you.
To a girl. Here.
What?
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
What else do you like?
No.  I'd have liked to.
What would you say?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
Yes.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Time to play.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
You a doctor, too?
What do you mean?
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
Yeah.
The Cenobites.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
What is it?
Oh, I'll bet you have.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Who wards off demons.
Reliquary --
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Each of us gets a belt.
No. Don't --
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No. I never was.
Out? Out out?
You're going alone?
Marco...
I know.
Oh, sod you.
Lucky man.
You can keep them.
No.
You remember.
This isn't happening.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Oh my God.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
Keep your voice down.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Where's Daddy?
Oh my God.
In here.
Don't go upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
Plain soda?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Gone?
It's late.
I see.
Your father told me you were working here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
You gotta be kidding me.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
What did he ever do to you?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You're not even coming?
No.  We need the gig.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
It's the new --
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Nobody.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
So.  Is now a good time?
Your desert island top-five.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Hey Rob.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
You look upset.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
I think you know that.
What, what?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Nevermind.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
We'll talk some other time.
Nothing.
That bad, eh?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I can't talk right now.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Yes, of course.
What do you want to do?
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
What about Ian?
Mission accomplished.
Want to know what, exactly?
To make you feel better.
More confident, maybe.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Just local, of course.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
I'm going to talk to you.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
So?
It's true!
Is Ray going?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
So you'll stay?
Right.
How's the store?
So so.  Up and down.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Seventy-five.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
Thanks.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
-Okay okay.
Yes.
It's not mine.
Grave robbers?
No.
You are being foolish.
Not all of them.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
It's beautiful.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
It'll never stick.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Never take up poker, Detective.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
It was time for our paths to cross.
Yes.  Always.
It is less.
I don't know why.
I don't understand.
I'm twenty-two.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Me arm hurts.
Go to hell.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
Muy Bien!
I do not think I like the sound of that.
I'll be back when I can.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Finish yours?
So sure?
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Second musketeer.
We have no understanding.
It never changes, Major.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Leave her out of this.
Leave her alone.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
Your murder weapon?
He's mistaken.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Fine.
Yes!
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
What home?
Just what I said. That's what I --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney.
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Keep away --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
He's in the insurance business.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
We're not interested.
What tricks would I pull?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I know, but --
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You got plenty of money?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Three bullets! Any good?
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
So long, Hildy.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
What went off?
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Just -- one -- second!
What?
A sight for sore eyes!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Who do you think!
You mean here in the city?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
We want to see you.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I don't mind.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
They've got the real thing outside.
The sodding water table.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And the bride.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Just ignore her, Mac.
No, I won't.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
How are we going to cope?
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Come on.
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
But if you did.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Perfect.
I don't know.
Cat fight, cat fight.
No problem.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Oh.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
I resign.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Huh?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
No, just a little too old.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Where's Bill?
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
When you were a little French girl?
Shh.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
What for?
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
I don't know.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
Ouch. Yeah?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Yeah?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
No. I married a midget.
Please, honey, let me in.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
With pleasure.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
You've got to respect that.
How's it going?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
What SPF, sweetie?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes, darling.
A deer?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Of course not.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I guess.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Got it.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Yes... Derek.
You want a chaser?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
You tell me.
That's the way it's done.
How much do I owe you?
Thought you only drank milk.
You being cute?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
That's your problem.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I said we're leavin'.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Fifty per cent?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Give me a drink, will ya?
He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
What for? To play Fats again?
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Oh no, nothing for me.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Try me.
Yes.
No, not always.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
Give me a drag.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Give it back to me.
Does it bother you? What he said?
You need the words?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Come here. Come on, now.
Why should I?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Is that a fact?
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
That is not now, human!
We move.  Place to place.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Yes.
Shhh... don't talk.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Virginia...?
Please.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
What did it look like?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Where's your car?
Good night.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Where, Jimmy?
But it's not, Jimmy.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
What happened to your other slipper?
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
A toast to the end of the world.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Can't this thing go any faster?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You can do that?
But what, General?
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
I said call them back.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
How dare he?!
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
What were they looking for?
The Grail Diary.
Don't know. Think of something.
It's important!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Well, uh...
Dad!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Very well. I'm here now.
I don't need camels.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
PET IT??!!
THE WHAT?!
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
No... the heart's still beating!
Quiet!
No... they won't kill me.
Not quite.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Willie, come on!
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Shut up!
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Who am I?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
I just went there for a job.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
No. Don't tell the guards.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Go out, take your first left.
Gone where?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Nothing!
I can't do that.
It's illegal.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Just get there.
Swim.
Where are you staying?
...Rene...
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
I made it work.
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
Not blue enough.
The beautiful one.
Just hold them close and stay still.
This just won't work.
What if she says something important?
Oh come on.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
It's not your time. I get time off.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Follow her.
On what?
I can't keep up.
Where are you going?
You think. That's what you're good at.
A hard left. A hard left.
I can't see a thing.
Neither can they.
You were with GRUNER!
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
Oh no!
They can?
Dieter?
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
What a nerve!
Rene?
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Thanks.
Oh.
Oh....Sure.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Sir?
The poet...something he said...
Where?
...Rene.
Me still. They left you alone?
Are you alright?
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
There's not much to tell.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No, he didn't do that.
He must be a good friend.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
What is it?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Then where's the chip.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What did you tell them?
Nothing we can do.
Can't you do something?
What?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
He told me what to do.
I told you, I work for him.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I don't know.
You can't take that.
It will be fine. You have another.
Yes.
Poor bastard.
There's Dad, on TV.
Push it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Alright, alright.
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
...my files! Personal correspondence...
Yeah?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Why? Who said?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
What do you mean?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
I'm with Don on this.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
It's okay.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
I told the truth... I told the truth.
You greased the rails!
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
You called me.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Right.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Most certainly.
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
Chapter and verse.
After you, Doll.
What part?
Who's the pigeon?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Is she Asian?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
And you've always loved him?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
No, that's not all.
Have you tried the duck?
Yes? Marylin?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Thank you.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Apparently she was very disappointed.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes.
I know.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I want to nail you ass.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's not something I wanted either.
Marylin?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
So where are you now?
Hello Miles.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
But you're going through with it?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
When you have a moment.
She's here now.
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I don't have a pre-nup
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
But then... But then...
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Mother?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Yes, sir?
"I found a million dollar baby—"
No—no. What the deuce do I want to—
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
The reward.
That's an evasion.
Do you love her?
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Who is he?
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Are you going to see him?
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
What would you like to have me do?
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Huh?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
The pleasure is all mine.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Well, you were!
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
What's got into you?
Here. Eat your head off.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Clever.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
You! Don't make me laugh.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Not interested. 
Won't I ever see you again?
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Get out!
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Eight o'clock.
Yeah!
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Huh?
I am, Joe.
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
Yeah.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Yes, Ma.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Why—no—
Yeah. Just babies.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
No.  Never heard of him.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
Get a hold of yourself.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
What are you driving at, boss?
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...and your General?
Ever ask him?
And he never hit you before?
You have other information?
The assassination, Jack?
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
And how tall are you?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
What'd ya mean?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
She almost sounds scared.
Sure.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
Can I see your I.D.?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
Ordell pick up his bond?
He's got that kinda money?
Cash poor?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
The Delfonics.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
What?... What'd you do?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Yeah.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
What'd ya see?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
You talk them into it?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
What if I've figured a way?
Do you think they bought it?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I hesitated taking that much.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
You ever see him sell guns?
I thought you were going to let this one through.
You two meet?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Hi, Melanie.
It looks good on you.
You betcha.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
Go sit over in that chair.
It's a cockatoo.
If you want.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I'll give ya ten.
Four days ago.
Two months shy of four years.
What for?
I thought you were sixteen.
No.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Uh-huh?
All right already.
Okay.
The moon -- I dunno
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
You couldn't just hit her?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Tell me.
They don't have your winning personality.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
You think you could do that?
You don't say.
House.
I got some more business for ya.
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Beaumont worked for you.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
I thought you might be asleep.
Git your ass in here.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
No.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
He leave town?
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
It's all been a dream.
What do you want?
I'm okay.
How do you know?
Oh, terrific.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
They're not interested, Jake.
There was a bang.
Now what?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Wiggle your toes.
Louis, you're a life saver.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I don't know what to say.
But I see them.
I'm not cold.
She was good in bed, though.
Your back? Did you fall?
Who did?
What do you mean?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
She looked good then.
Not to me.
How's it going?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
While you were in the shower.
It might be for me.
Stick with me, kid.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Sit down, Jake.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I don't know you.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
So why tell me now?
I don't know.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Total delirium.
I'm sorry.
I need to see you.
What do you mean?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
He doesn't like it.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
I don't know. Nothing.
Thorgan? You coming?!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
You'll be fine.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
I'm just saying.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
What?!!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Old Earth?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Here --  Take him home.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I think they make you look sexy.
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
He's sitting in it.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
What? What?!
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
They must've hit something.
This is quite a place.
Some friends and me took a house.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Is anyone having this...?
You're leaving?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Well... is everything all right?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I'm okay...
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Okay.
Yup.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
No... I guess not.
What are you talking about?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
No, he's the dad.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Cute?
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
You do?
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
You've never been to a dance, have you?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
What's the matter?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
God, you're so young.
You should try Adderall.
I heard that was you.
Really? Fingernails?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Juno MacGuff.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Please stop now.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Can you see it?
What?
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
...Thank you.
Took 'em all.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
What?
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
This guy killed a mess of people.
You wanna hear mine?
Thank god!
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Take your time.
I'm finished.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
No, thanks, I can manage.
...Brian hurt his foot.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
She can fuck?
Oh man, that's the best.
Right.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Why I do what?
You are?
Yeah me too.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Right now?
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Why is that?
15.
Yeah.
Yeah?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
No.
What?!
But then I won't need your money.
Not too late.
Hello?
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
What?
No it wasn't.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
You think he's dirty?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Why not?
You're not going to tell me that.
You know her?
Just like who?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I just can't believe it.
You're losing me.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Who's Kathy?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
And this Jeremy--
This ain't no photo.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Whatever's on your mind.
Mate in five.
No.
Feel like practicing?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
How come you don't stay with them?
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
She could be dead after the game.
I don't think I could.
In a way.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
I know it was bad.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I'm not playing a game now.
I thought you said the line was busy?
Nothing.
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Why not?
It could be anything.
He didn't tell you either.
Me too.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Colwyn ...
I know it.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
What do you see?
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Where the spiral begins.
I chose the wrong passage.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
I can. Because I choose it.
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
Yes.
Even by you?
Yes.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
You will not, then?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Yes, my lord.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Sugarballs?
No.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Hush!
Yes.
Ynyr!
Where is he? My son.
Of what?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Yes.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Whoever.
No.
Mathilda?!
A little...
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...I don't know.
Yes.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Why am I such an authority?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I have new dreams now.
No it's not.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
How long does this... Mania last?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
You're talking to me?
I think it's a different place for each person.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Go to sleep Ellen.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
Perhaps there's another route?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Where?
Walking where?
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
In a hospital.
Hello.
OK... whatever.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Thank you. What time is it?
Very clever.
What do you mean?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
OK.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Yuri... are you...
I have a 4.0.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I believe we are.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Tell him, Paulette.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I think so...
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I'm so happy for you!
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
What?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Your scrunchie?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
So?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
What?!
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
What, like on va-kay?
Really --
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Well, yeah, but --
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
Not from me, surely...
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
To be my bride, of course.
I'd soon die.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one...
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
The chill is worse this night.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Sunlight, you say?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
I detest serpents.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
Who?
I don't want it on me.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Only what's right...
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Everywhere!  Ow!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
You follow.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Since seventh grade.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
It's so beautiful.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Nope.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
I don't want you to!
Why are you so uptight?
What are you talking about?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
You've been good this week.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
We're getting out of the ground today.
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
Because I live there.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
That's not true.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Sun glasses?
Do you ever wish you had done it?
She seemed upset.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Why call me?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
I want him with me.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
What have you been before today?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
Finished or unfinished?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
You're not well.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
If I weren't married?
You got the money?
I wasn't sure.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Then what's the problem?
Yeah...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
That's because I've never been here before.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I don't think so.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
What gave you that idea?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
What'd you say?
You drew this?!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You get ketchup?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Whatever.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Hey, Ray...
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Show him Central Park.
A speech impediment?
It would be so okay.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Coulda been much worse.
You got it.
It's Stanley, sir.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
You smell like coconuts.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
The South.
Why are you laughing?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
School?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
From my dad's side of the family.
I love you.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
We're ready.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
It has nothing to do with you.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
He was killed.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Curious.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
That's tomorrow.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Things change!
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Yes...
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
They're comin' with us.
Pile in.
You okay?... What's wrong?
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Hi.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?... What else?
You killed him.
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Alice?
Dick Laurent?
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He didn't come home.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No, no. I want to go in.
What are you going to do?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I called, you know.
Yeah?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Who the hell owns that dog?
Which would you choose?
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
You're my man, Pete.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
I don't know.
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Well, what do you know about that!
Uh-huh.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Sounds like a stall to me.
In a quandary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
It's unbelievable.
Say, what about that gold deal?
All right.
Over by that hill.
Leaving?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
You're startled?
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Shall we have another?
Suppose she should leave it?
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No porters here!!
Why, no.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
Yes.
What is it, my son?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Yes, Bob.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What are you talking about?
Let me go, Bob!
I don't see that there's anything to say.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I'd go mad!
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Maria?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
She came here in 1888!
What do you suggest?
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
I'd love it!
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
English!
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Yes.  Barney!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
The hell were you thinking?
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
You got smeared.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Actually, sir--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Sir--
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
So what's the problem?
Um-- Kay?
Let's check am out.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
How could it not?
Nothing.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Will it lower the curve?
Wait-- listen--
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Where's he making his big speech?
What is it?
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
RUN!
Because I found out about her...
It's all I could safely move.
Here --
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
In the middle of the night?
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
I'm not getting halo'd.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
She said...
Oh... Hi, John.
They don't belong to anybody.
All right, I'll try...
It's a little late for that.
I wanted to.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
So you won't help me?
Why?
The system would collapse.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Tell him not now.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
I wanna kill my boss.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Two?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Have you been there recently?
Yes.
No thank you.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
No.
He's great, right. Is he great?
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Mommy's not home?
Where were you?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Oh, please.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Get your hands off of her.
I don't get it.
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Where's Ricky.
She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
I don't understand.
No.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
What drill?
Nah, man...
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
You don't know where you're going?
Well, this is the corner.
Taken care of?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
Any time, bro.
What are you saying?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
I thought you hate that club.
Shhh...
He didn't say we need guns.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
She really liked the kitchen.
I'll get the girl.
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
I mean, that's what I heard --
Back in.
We're getting whacked.
We're not getting whacked.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
The penguin house.
Wanna bet?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
You're not getting a gun.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.
Ugh...
You strapped?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
No?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
How's it going?
Come, now. You just got here.
So you're our own private guy?
What?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
It's a digestif.
She poured it for --
He has a cute what...?
That's none of your fucking business.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
I am.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
He had it coming.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
I'm working on it.
You never had it.
I'm wearing, Archie.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
I know.
I just want to sit here and be still.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Dear heart, I love you.
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
That's right.
Please, go ahead.
Entirely.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
I ain't stupid.
Get out.
Eat lead, coppers.
That's right.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
I have connections.
Where does he live?
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[Who's he?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Correct!]
Have you used this type before?
It's loaded.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
If they like me.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
No.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
No.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
No.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
It's Creasy.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
I think it's fantastic.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Creasy.
[Is that good or bad?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I been looking all over for you!
You want me to ride down with you?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
It's her baby too, you know.
Well, it ain't your baby.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Who?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Please...
We just live one flight up.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Goodnight.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
About eight o'clock.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Sure.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Right.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
Waddaya talking about?!!
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Where?
No.  Or why you should.
Look at that right eye.
Or her figger.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Wisconsin.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
We been had.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
And it's the ninth inning.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
When?
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
C-A-M-E-M...?
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Radar!
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
Oh, Jesus.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
It's possible
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It isn't always this rough?
Same here.
You think he won't.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Second pint.
Thanks.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
No, never in the slightest.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
That. It's out of the act.
I don't think so either.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
Your tent?
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Yeah, that's the one.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Yes, sir.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
What John Doe?
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Thank you.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
What?
Sure. Mostly often.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah. It certainly is.
Sure.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
Huh? Get what?
No.
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Thanks.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Shh!
No, sir.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Yeah, okay.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
I'll take half of your action.
What happened, Mike.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...a car.
Earl.
I have to go face to face.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Only at the very end.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
It was okay.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Well, if I have to, I have to.
I think I can handle that one.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Okay, stop.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
About six years. My partner took me.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
And what if you can't live with it?
Which apartment?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
You heard.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You think I didn't need you?
And it's hard to get.
Yeah that's it.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
And you think he'll...
A deeper level?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
What?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Yeah, they are but...
It's all been transferred.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Then what?
Yes...
And what about the reconfiguration?
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
The truth.
The truth.
Not his style.
No.
But you were with me.
Just like that?
Checking connection.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Zordon...  he's gone.
Now tell me... what do you see?
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
... We must try to communicate with them.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
There's enough for everybody!
You want me to place a few calls?
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
And I ain't no nigger either!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Life knocked me back.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
You got men on Profaci's place?
That ain't what your mama said.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
No. I'm here with you.
Same here.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
Like a party for all our friends.
How soon can we pull this off?
It'll just be a few minutes.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Ben-jamin.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
I know about you.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
But that's an hour's drive.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
The name's Charlie.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Jesus.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Uhh - martini?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Monkeybone...!?
Got a doctor on duty.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
<u>What</u> union?
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Isn't that Lulu?
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Have a nice day.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Uh-huh?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mm hmm.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Where's the Majority Leader?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Looks like it, but--
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
What! Who?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Any time.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
My first name's--Clarissa.
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
You know, we're getting married.
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
We're waiting, Hubert.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Horace Mill--!
Henry Hill.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Jefferson--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
Pleased to meet you, sir.
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Right.
Tonight.
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Why?
Some committee's got it.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Hurray!
A camp! Well!
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Ring the call to quorum.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Let's get away from here. 
I know that.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Some people like it.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Oh yes, pixilated.
He sure is pixilated.
Always.
Uh-huh.
Any children?
No, no children.
Why not?
Your Honor!
NO!!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
You are , aren't you?
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
I enjoy it.
What are they going to do?
Now, what do you see?
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
What did he play?
He did?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Mary - I - excuse me—
Yes, of course.
No. It's nothing.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Have lunch.
Had the boys follow us.
When're you going to see him again?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
John—
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Nuisance value?
Mr. Cedar!
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Buffer?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Only common sense.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Don't pay any attention to her.
South Dakota north.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Oh, I do too, sir.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Could you come with me please?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
What kind of doubts?
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Do you want to come in?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Yes, your honor.
Yes.
You do?
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
What do you want to know?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
That would explain it.
What kind of doctor are you?
That's right, the fake kind.
What?
What do you mean?
I think you do.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
I've offended you!
No.
Sorry... I'm done.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Either one.
That's one way to put it.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Um-huh.
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
True. Should we stop them?
How are you?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
I understand.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Yep.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
It wasn't the best situation.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
All new people start with that...
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
See you Thursday... regular time.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Wow.
What?
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
I've had worse.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You will not believe it.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
And what did he say?
Three hundred pounds!
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
And what is that?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
That bad huh?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
You lied to me!
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Did you ever see him eat?
Um, well, you see...
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Of course.
Except for one little thing.
Do I?
I'm his daughter.
Atta, boy!
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
I can't.
Let's do it.
I got it.
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Really?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Monica, where are you?
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We had an off night, that's all.
With what?
So why don't you just tell her!
See ya tomorrow.
No.
We're superheroes.
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Ow.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
The Disco Boys.
Be a Mohican. 
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
Whatever our name is.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
I did, sir.
There are none here.
But who made this treaty?
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
When you eat him, may I have some?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
That is correct.
No, sir.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Do you have three francs, sir?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
When is she supposed to return?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
And now?
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Promise me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Certainly.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
About Hippolyte Charles.
How do you know?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
That is a matter of opinion.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Yeah.
Why you say that?
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
I'll do it.
Naw, I already ate.
Black magic.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Fuck, what's his name?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
I don't.
I don't know yet.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Wait for what?
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
It's locked.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
It's alright.
Excuse me?
Nice to meet you?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
You damn right that's the big one.
Bite his ear!
Call me.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Nothing.  What you want?
You just come in on Amtrack?
San Diego.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Aw, too bad.
That's...a comfort to hear.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
Let' s do it.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I know you do, honey.
I promise.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Kill the Governor.
Hi.
What!?
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Come with me, honey.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Keep talkin', Preacher.
You understand?
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
How's your sister Pearl?
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
About what!
Come on!
There's something else.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
How?
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Nothin'!
It -- she --
Come on, children!
Yes. Yes.
Why sure, boy, sure.
Yes?
All right.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
The Lord will provide.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
When did I ever?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
No, nothing.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Get the kit!
No.
You believe in anything?
Uh-oh...
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
You do?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
He's dangerous.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
I don't mean her --
Right home after. See you.
Great
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
An omelet.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
I have nothing to hide.
An evening gown.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Right now it's on the balcony.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
That's all right.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Count d'Algout...
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Yes, monsieur.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Au revoir.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Confess what?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
I must get into that country of yours!
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
In other words you don't know.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I will do my best.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
And what do you do for mankind?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
Don't do it, please.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
It's twelve o'clock.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
What?
Will you smile?
Why?
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
No.
Yes.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
You see? Life can be so simple.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Ninotchka, I love you.
A funny story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
They belong to the people.
Please.
So happy and so tired.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Oh, yes.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
She's gone, Leon.
Madame, if you...
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
You leave me no choice.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
Yes, it does.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Where the hell is he?
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Yeah?
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
I thought the gloves were off.
... go on.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
That's what they're doing.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
Can we get around this, Al?
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
It's the parents' fault really.
Sir?
Let him finish, Bob.
I believe you're right, boss.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
What about the documents he promised?
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
You're fucking me.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
You don't think he was a hero?
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
That was a long time ago.
Where you from?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Sir?
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
I'll never run again.  I promise.
I don't want them to love me.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I've missed you.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
Someday, Dick.
The "crises"?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
In Angola. Yeah.
Yes, you've circled round.
Yes I do.
No ID in her room?
Yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Some pretty bad people.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Uh-huh.
Llewelyn Moss?
Mm.
But you don't believe it.
No sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
No sir.
I never do.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Just keep it up.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Well -- how come?
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Uh-huh.
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
She'll be all right.
I mean the nature of you.
Yes.
With anything?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
You said that.
Sir?
No.
You on all night?
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
What room?
It's all right.
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
How well do you know Chigurh.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Another additional.
Not that way.
No. You don't understand.
I'm retired.
I don't mean braze.
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
...I meant your food.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
What about it?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
No, I was just... How you doing?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Oh, this is wonderful...
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Yes, ma'am.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
No... what about your sister?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
I gotta go make dinner.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Yes... maybe it was.
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
Did you love it?
What's his real name?
Worse.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
He has a wife?!
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
You should have a little faith in people.
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Where are you going?
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Good.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
...and put them in your mouth.
Now, that's really stupid.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
"Injuns?"
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Would you say she was ambitious?
No... before that.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Fire! I hate fire!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
That ain't it!
Problem a p'seption.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
It was a powerful air.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
What for?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Who gave you this idea?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Aw screw it...
Well, goodbye.
What did you call me, boy?
Where are you from, boy?
I said, come here!
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Then, I'll see you around.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
What?
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
So?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
It's mine.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
Please...
This is ridiculous...
I can't just...
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
The hell we are.
How many more do we have after this?
478-0150.
Don't.
Fuck her too.
People.  In the house.
What?!
Yeah.
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Get the fuck out of my house!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who's they?
Man, fuck you!!!
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
N... N...... Not... Oh.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Are you finished?
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
What, I don't know how you mean?
Well, act like it. Come on.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.
I expect to try.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Who cared for your wounds?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Sir?
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Pride is his weakness.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
What?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
I know.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
When?
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
Yes, he does.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
To remember.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
You believe in it.
Not at all.
What?
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
I don't know.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Then come on.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Whose burying ground?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Your cairn.
What did we do, Jud?
Yes.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
It's beautiful!
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Yes, I guess I do.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You can't.  I can.
He didn't waste it.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Wait as long as you like.
What're you suggesting?
Aye, for us there is.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Will -- you can't trust him.
Boy overboard!
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
If I had known --
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
That he is.
We're catching up!
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
Only a little.
Where does it make berth?
How?  The key's run off.
We need to go!
I swear, you look just like him.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Jack!
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
And no lies!
He's not telling the truth.
But --
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
No.
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Do you think she loves him?
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Consideration?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Shut up and do it!
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
A man?
What are you going to do?
Who isn't?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
The big house?
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Yeah, we'll see.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't?
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
The waste.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
We were different people then.
Oh yeah?
It's a miracle.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
You're all right.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
No - give you another guess.
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Of course I am Stewart.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Gallagher?
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Why—
Sit down!
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know—
Well, I should say!
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Gloria Golden?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
A what?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Araby, my eye—!
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes sir!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
—and that—
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
To Old Madrid.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
You don't.
Sure.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Are the cars ready?
Why—
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
I beg your pardon?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
I understand, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Yes sir.
It doesn't matter.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
No I'm not.
Really Biff? The keenest?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
No way.
Owns the hardware store.
What do you mean?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Well if I don't who will?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Sure.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Right here.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
... Lover's Lane?
Oh ... Right.
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
... Like Prince Charming.
Nice ... Nice ...
I can't.
Excuse me?
Oh--well ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
Oh.
So they can have their hamburgers!
Christmastime.
Aren't you a little early?
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
What's the rush?
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Yeah but what are you doing?
No, no, no.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Hello everyone.
I have work, I can't leave.
I don't know.
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Hi, is this Jack?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
Really?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
Georgia.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
You don't even know how much it is.
....what....?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
No.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Sure.
Yeah.
You like her?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see?
So that was your pudding?
What?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
You don't think you'll go --
This is Lena.
Ok.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Yeah?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I'm fine are you ok?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
I cut myself.
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Please don't do this to me.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Barry Egan.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
That's that.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Hi Walter.
That was weird. I meant good.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
I'm sorry.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Yeah.
That's funny.
What?
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
What are you doing?
Seriously.
You can't just stay in your house.
I won't.
As soon as you want.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
What's the problem?
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
You ready?
Bye, Barry.
It's fine.
Once or twice.
Then what's he doing here?
By whom? The Marquis?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
It's not even noon --
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Coulmier, you animal!
An innocent child is dead.
I know, because I felt it myself --
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
HER NAME, ABBE.
But I am history.
Yes?
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher mission.
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
-- words alone are insufficient.
Of course.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
And he did.
Sure
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
Pops
It's not really--
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Marion--
There's nothing to explain
You are repellant when you drink.
The drinking.
Sir? 
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir, I-
We're using-
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
This better be good
Mank-
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Herman.
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
For Christ's sake, shut up--
It's just that my movie is so-
Happy birthday.
We done?
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Ok, champ.
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
And where you goin'?
Where's your wife, Jake?
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
You want the title shot or not?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
No, I just told you what happened.
Well, I heard some things.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Yeah. At night.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Who asked you?
You asleep?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
All I did...
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
C'mon, Tommy --
All right, I'll try. See you later.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
That depends on who "they" were.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
You did.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I'll send you some comic books.
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah.
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Stella!
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Who's Thorwald?
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Lisa! Shut up!
Three.
Without any future?
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
Something too frightful to utter.
What are you getting at?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Thinking about Thorwald?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
I do?
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
But you're not?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Jim Stark.
We got to do something.  Don't we?
How'd he get in?
You see any cops?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
No.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Shoot, Jimbo.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Open it.
Come back tomorrow.
I don't want to make friends.
Who knows.  Plato?
They're looking for you!--
What?
Come on!
I'm what?  What?
Get away from me!
You sure?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
I need it.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
They like you.  Okay?
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Why should you be the only one.
I don't know why--!
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
They never do.
Chicken?
Bully for you.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I bet you hear everything I say!
How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know.
Hi.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You smell like baby powder.
They're killing him!
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Hi.
Don't hurt him...
YES!!!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, c'mon --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
JESUS CHRIST!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
No, Nick, no --
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
Nick...
Part of... with them?
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
No, you can't --
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
What'd they call her in college?
I don't know.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Put it on.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
NO!
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
Six men means six guns.
No, you're not.
'Tis the season, convict.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
GO!!!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Mr. Bangs.
Acid-chewer.
Five years. Since it opened.
Merlin, I didn't know --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Not yet.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
GUARD!!!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
NICK!!!
You gave them me.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
What?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
...What bar?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't tip.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Why not?
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Where? Are they out in the car?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Well, he knows a little about me.
He asked.
If we don't, he'll die.
Not these guys.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
You can stay here if you like.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I hope so, too.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
That's fine.
You're not going out to look for them?
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
Like what?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
You'll live.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Nobody asked you to.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Depends on how good you drive.
Now where's she goin'? --
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
I don't care what he thinks.
What for?
Yeah, we sure have.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
If you need me, I'll be --
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Ha! Right bitch!
Thanks.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
It looks like the furnace.
Yes...
Can you feel that?
Listen to me I --
Oh, right.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
I'll go.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Are these all the subjects?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
That one.
Hi.
You do.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Okay, give me my belt.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
What does it say?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
What happened?
He's really cute!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Thanks, Mom.
I'm so happy I could shit.
You scared me.
This is so silly. 
That's right.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
No woman would!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
I love that you're my wife.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
Yes, I was.
We all have bad nights. 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Right here!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yeah —- sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Which room is it?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
"The Dante?"
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Yes.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Good night.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Why wait?
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Uh—huh.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
I think it's time.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Please.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Oh.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
How do you mean?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
So you don't believe in therapy?
Of course not.
Basically, yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
You know?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Then do it.
Does he go down on you?
Yes.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Can't or won't?
So you lied to her?
How come?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Why not?
No.
Yes.
I don't know.
Because.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Always the lawyer.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Why?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Did you do anything?
So it was recently that you tried this.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Because I never got around to it.
I don't want to talk about it.
What!?
You don't know that for sure.
You are in trouble.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Hold on.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
And you ask questions, right?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
I'd like to make another tape.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Could be risky.
Maybe.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
She's there? What's she doing there?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
I like the way he dresses.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
No.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
So is my wife, asshole!!
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Sure.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Uh, OK. Sure.
Down to the incinerator.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Why Janet?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
I don't want to get up there.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
Sure thing.
Absolutely correct.
That doesn't make sense.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Farley!
Fast!
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
SIN-I-FUL
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
We love you, Baby.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
How's the trip?
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Bottle.
You got it.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Maybe. Recognize this?
I am one of those guys.
I can't help the traffic.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yeah, Conundrum.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Now we're talking.
When do we get to drink it?
Want some?
Pour us a couple.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Beautiful.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Nah. I want to watch this.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
You're an asshole.
Obsessively.
Shut up.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
I SAID OKAY?
Are they too sporty?
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You're so negative.
Good for you.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Yeah, same here.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
What rehearsal dinner?
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
That's great.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
You golf?
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
It tastes old.
A hair.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
I don't feel much.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Yes.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
I would say so.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Don't worry.
What do you mean, the horses?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
It's one thing to know it...
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?
I haven't done anything.
You got no idea what they were after?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
They got a saloon there?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
All right, you buy me a drink.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
What about the law?
The other guy drew first.
What now?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
You can't do this.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What do you mean?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Good-bye.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Almost right.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
There isn't one.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- I can explain.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
I can imagine.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Not if I don't let her.
You?
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
You look so, so...
Yes, call me Simone.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
Why?
I read.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know what you're up to.
Abduction?
This should take care of Mother.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Taller?  What?
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
--Do I know you?
Tell me.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Thanks.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
I don't tell her a thing.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Who me?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
You believe me, right?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
No.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Maybe.
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Tell you my secrets.
A lady. She died.
Ghosts.
You think I'm a freak?
Got it.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
S-ssstop that!
Chuck E. who?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Not lately.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Hi Suze.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Not while you're driving.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Chicken sandwich?
Yes!
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
I said that's enough!
Getting ready.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
Listen to me --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
'Mornin', Jack.
And that makes you look like a squid?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
Starla, it ain't --
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Don't worry, Chief.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Out.
My present?
When one sees you they all see you.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
I give up.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Ciao.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
And?
Yes.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Waynette!
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Bandit?
Save it. We got a long haul.
Not for long, you ain't.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Yeah, guy?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I ran into complications.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
Yeah, but...
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Yes, ma'am.
How's your twenty?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
What kind of personnel?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Pretty much, yep.
Mmm-hmm.
Two of 'em?
...About what?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I'm not doing cocaine.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I got his machine.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I thought Heller was a double op?
A million flat.
No shit.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
True?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
What were you doin' here anyway?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
...What are they doin' right now...?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
That's fantastic.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
No.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
Just get him to stop.
Into what?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
I'll just be a minute.
Yes.
I wasn't.
Stop it.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
You don't know?
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
You don't love me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
Gibarian.  He was here.
It's all right.
Rheya --
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
It's an experiment.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Looks a little constipated to me.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
I'm supposed to call in.
Queens... You know Queens?
I got money.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
No dog.
You don't like him, do you?
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Not exactly.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Too kinky.
Get in bed.
You got no idea...
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
I'll be right up.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I watched TV.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
What's the difference?
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
No, I need'm now!
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
You should'a brought the girl.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
Why should she come in?
No. No, that's okay.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Remember Little League?
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Mm-hmm.
That's not even close.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
You're making my life difficult.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Some things you should say anyway.
I-- uh--
What?
But you like that in a man?
Some prep school thing.
I'd never admit that.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
I know what you mean.  I...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
You sure about all this?
Use a fork.
See?  You big dullard.
How is he?
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
No!
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
What?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Plenty.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
What's the match gag?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Yeah.
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
Let's!
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
You should live so long.
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Betty Grable!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
I'll open mine, too.
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
You have a Lieutenant here...
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Says who?
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Here. Take them.
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Where is he now?
Can I?
Please, please.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Is there a problem?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Aye, sir.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Not from here, no.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
None that I can detect, sir.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Aye, sir!
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Goodbye, David.
You would have done the same for me.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
About a dozen officers and men.
Come on!
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Because you wish it.  

I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
What you ask is difficult.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Understood, my lord.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
How is that...?
I'm not a drama critic.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
I can spare me...
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Who --
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Never mind! Hurry!
What do you want with us? I demand --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
We encoded four minutes --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Or the one.
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Too late --
Best speed, Scotty...
Steady as you go...
Or the one.
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
I did not think so.
Energize defense fields.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Aye, sir.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Aye, sir --
Scotty!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
I do this because I was there,
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
I liked him better before he died.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
The top of what?
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
I buy that. What about him?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Noon tomorrow...?!
Here... In the park?
But Kirk...
A spaceship with a missing man.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Picture, please.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Aye, sir!
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
How long, Scotty?
Full power, sir.
You will be in good hands here.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
But not you.
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I aspire to be more than I am.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
And our people?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
I believe it is safe, sir.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
It is not over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
We're not going anywhere.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Make it so.
We have to find shelter...
Why was Data assigned?
... I believe you...
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
But how?
Where?
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
<U>Engage.</U>
Active.
Great name. French?
Yes.
Invasion.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Yes, he is.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
We're still in Earth orbit.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Agreed. Options?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Understood!
Emergency override!
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
What are you suggesting?
Riker here.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
What kind of message?
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
Specifically of...?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Now there's a poser.
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
How can I trust --
Yes...
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
WHO ELSE...?
Aye, sir.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Make ourselves a target?
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
Such things have happened before, sir.
An omission. After that -
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
You are me.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
No.
For how long?
Is he very much like you were?
Can you describe it, Deanna?
To happy endings.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Well then... only one way to go.
Ready, Captain.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.

Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
Of course, sit down.
Make it so.
You sick bastard!
Thank you, Commander.
What do we know about the planet?
What do we know about the population?
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
On screen.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
Captain!
Aye, sir
I intend to.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Yes.
You know I do.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Were we always explorers?
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
You're not Reman.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
Why are you here?
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Please.
I am.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Do as I tell you!
What?!
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
They're holding position.
Silence, Romulan!
For the moment.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
Shermin...
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
Marc Shermin.
Gear shift.
Good.
Flashlight.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
This car runs on gas.
Yes. Very good.
From?
I know.
Shit... shit... what shit?
I...
It was yellow.
No.
Eh... yes...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
What is hitchhike?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
What is hell?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
You're damn right I am.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I understand.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
No, thank you.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
You have no conception of this, do you?
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
You're going down.
I live for the moment.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Watch and see.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Make me forget it, baby.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Can't do it.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
What a nightmare.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
What do you mean?
Jesus!
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
I always do.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Define illegal.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
There's a plus side?
No, it's not.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Yeah.  We did.
Just Lenny.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
You're thinking...?
Who knows.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
She's buried.
Winona.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yes.
He had an orange hat on.
Just an observer.
Who?
Its called insubordination.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
None taken.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Don't even go there. What's up?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
"Gone live?"
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
You were right. He found me.
I'll be back.
Yes, sir.
So you went underground?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Those were just fantasies.
[Follow me.]
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
Murman!
I know, I know.
Shut up.
...maybe...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Anything?
What else is going on?
Me too.
I'll be around.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
...The red piece of shit over there...
Yeah?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Well that sucks.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Oh no?
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah, there's the rub...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
He's trying to be an actor.
Damned if I know...
You asshole.
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Vegas!
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
That's not cool.
Always.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Let's go.
Who's the big winner?
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
No! Not the camera guy!
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
How?
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
This version doesn't have fighting?
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...through the kitchen...
No, baby!
A day.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
What was cold about it?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
True.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's definitely on.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Shut up.
Like hell I will.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Sure.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
Should I bring him in.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
You mean Tattaglia.
Maybe I can help.
And this?
For killing a man.
Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
An Act of Congress!
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
Beautiful all over, eh?
Get rid of them...
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
We should hear what they have to say.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Who is he?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the legs at the knees...
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Just you.
Please say it.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
I'm busy.
Tell me!
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Theresa.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Well, we ate everything without you.
We?
I don't like you.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
What?
Sure. I love Venice.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Relax.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
What are you talking about?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Oh God, I don't think so.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Aye, aye.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Dickie?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
That's a terrific idea.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Oh Marge.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
We'll be there.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I'll fix some drinks.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
I really don't want to see anybody.
31 people.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Tomorrow.
I got money.
How much to get a permit to carry?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I bought a couple of tickets.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
He's Black, OK?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
With the other hand, right?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
Nah.  I suppose not.
Easy.
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
Cops don't do nothin.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
Education?
Yes, Sir.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
You would, huh?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
O.K., cowboy.
Slow.
Yeah?
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Tell me what you really do.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
You knew?  All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
... including me.  Right?  
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Me too.
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
What did... what did I want to be?
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
My what?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
No.  But...
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
We live in a theater?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
I was decorated.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
I'm not sorry for what I said.
I taught you that.
No, I...
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Oh.
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Cathy?
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Yes, I did.
Would you like some brandy?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
I don't understand.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I did.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
Look.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Well, I suppose...
Darling, of course I do!
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
I don't know, honey.
Is she all right?
No, it's Lois!
Yep.
Mmmm.
What name?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
We'll make our own fog.
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Get a rope!
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Please.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
These birds were...
Yes.
He's not home.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
How can you tell?
Ahhh, but I know you.
I didn't break that window!
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
What kind of law?
Only violators and practical jokers.
What for?
You like me, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Certainly, but...
His wife changed the channel.
Oh, yes.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes, I was lying.
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
I'll get it.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Ask this one favor --
Yes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Aye.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Yes, I suppose so.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Why, yes.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
No.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
The heart pumps it.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
What did you hear?
Only Brother.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
Yes, Doctor.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
Aye --
Where are they?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
I know her friends.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
My father.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I know.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Are you ok?
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
Looks like you have them both on.
I don't believe you.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Professor Barnhardt.
Okay.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
What do you mean, dear?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Where is that?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
You know about the United Nations?
Your impatience is quite understandable.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Yes--?
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
That's right.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
They would have killed this man?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
You gotta drive!
That's just the way we like it.
<u>Four</u> to go.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
I will, David!
I can't do that!
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
We are...
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Get out, Mom!  Run!
Must be a circuit breaker.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
What do you mean?
Me, too.
Okay.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
No... no, everything's different now...
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Will you give Mom a break?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Piss off.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
What about Mom?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
The Marines.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Watch Clark.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Look, I'm just guessing...
That's good enough.
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Come on, Copper.
After all this mess then.
I am going after them.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Just keep looking.
Well, let's get down there.
He's one of them.
On the towers?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
What happened?
This is it?
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Yes.
It was meant to.
Vox...
I don't understand.
Created?
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
It can't all be like this...
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
I'm a foolish man.
I -- what are you?!
Dance with me...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
We took a walk three days ago.
So it's astronomy now, is it?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
Oh?
For God's Sake, David --
Do you find her?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
Or mud carriers.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Orion's belt...
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Do you have it?!
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
New Yorkers.
No...
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I suppose so.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Depends on what you're seeing.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
No, we were patients.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
That's too bad.
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I don't know.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
There're no cars on this street.
To the hospital.
Ok.
I don't understand.
[Beat] I don't know.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
What for?
So what am I supposed to do?
Becker does? Are you sure?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Good.
[Beat] Thanks.
You remember it?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Have a good day at work today.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
What?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
I'm spinning.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Who's your friend?
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Why now, Jimmy?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Thelma kinda took to him.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
I... I...
You're right.
Just past Boise City.
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Before.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Suck my dick... Boom!!
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
We've gone insane.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Grrrreat!
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
The thing's kind of heavy.
So you admit it?
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
He implied it.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Never?
You're kidding? What did they say?
His mother?
What?
Huh? But why did Healy?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Mary.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
No I can't.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Thanks.
No thanks.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
I work with retards.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Great.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
-- Love story of our time.
I guess.
Well, I'll see ya.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Who the hell's Woogie?
Any idea where I might start looking?
I don't buy it.
No.
You can't be serious.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Kim and I are close friends!
Who?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
How'd you manage that one?
I never said that.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Are you all right?
Just a minute.
Thanks.
All right, let's go.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
It.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Huh...?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
What --
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
What's gotten into you?
Something your father would've come up with.
Yeah.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Dean Rusk!
I know, I know...
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Don't get too attached.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Again. Figures, man.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Good. Thank you.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
That's right.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What'd you expect to hear?
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Nothin'. Forget it.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
So they took care of Leo.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
I desecrated it?
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
That's all!
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
On his six.
No.
Apology acknowledged.
Too aggressive?
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Evan... or Maverick.
What plane.
I'm different.
It's not suffering anymore.
You don't have to kill it.
About as much as they think about killing me.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You want to go ballistic?
And now?
. Yeah!
Why, what's gonna happen?
This is it, then.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
What kind of games?
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
Your watch.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Well?
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
What is?
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
280, 290, 300 knots.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Is it you?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Come on, relax...
Just once, if they take your plane away.
What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
I've had enough...for now.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
What'd you do?
That's because you don't have any women.
GOT 'EM.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
LOOK OUT!
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
So have I.
Some guys never get it back.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
How's it goin', Coog?
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You got the job.
And you get a kickback.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
I'd advise you to hurry.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Yes, sir.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
At Rekall.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Yeah.
C'mon!
Yeah.
Well don't.
I did?
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Mmmm.....
You know I do.
Let's do it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
They did!  But I killed them!
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Nice to meet you.
How real does it seem?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Get out!
You two-faced-bastard.
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
Could we make it to the mountains?
You're really leaving, huh?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
That's the plan.
Adios, bridge!
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Oh shit!
Sons of bitches!
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Right.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Only if something happens to me.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Civil?  I'm civil.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
The con...!  Oh my God.
It's...gone...!
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
It does.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Good point.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
What about entrapment?
Oh really?
We had a description of the suspect.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
We're taking the other case.
-- You found his mugshot?
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
-- Roger -- ?
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
It was self-defense.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
-- Eddie told you?
-- Every word.
That's right.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Soldado.
The phone company was broken up.
What color hair will she have?
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
God damn, you people are confusing.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
ALBERT?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
No, sir, we did not.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Any friends?
Ever see her with someone else?
Thanks.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Well, why not?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Donna, you are a muffin.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
You're not mad at me?
I can't help you there.
But I love you, Laura.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Fill 'er up.
I haven't got it yet.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
What does Bob say?
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I am The Muffin.
And what a muffin you have.
What? She asked about my father?
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
I can't tonight.
See what?
Hiking?
You're getting warmer.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I forgot my books at school.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Mom, take it easy.
School?
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
A friend from school.
No.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
What did you say?
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
I...
I...
I'm just an M.D.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Well, we...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
There's nothing they can do to me.
No, you did fine.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
Yes.
I'm sorry...?
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
...that's perfectly all right.
One hour.
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Yes. It was, actually.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Do you want me to go...?
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Kathy Price.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...I understand...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
Right.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
In New York?
As I've said we had some more...
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I liked him.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Can I read it?
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Absolutely.
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
Coming for you...
Read me some?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Steady...
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Me?  Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
You sound so sure.
Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Yes sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Congratulations.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
Because it looks good.
Me too.
Yes.
Maybe it's an air raid.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
All stop on the engine.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
I know.
I should be eating with the crew.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
And being sixteen.
Shut up donut.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Joy, rapture...
Sorry won't cut it.
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
This be it?
We don't have no paper bags.
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
You an indian?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
But I am also with the government.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
So?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Who knows, baby?
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
More'n likely.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Oh shit...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
You upset with me?
It's a comfortin' idea.
One bad car accident...
Let's leave here.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
SAILOR!!!!
Six.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
What if I asked you not to?
What if I told you not to?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
You need to explain it.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Where?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
On one condition...
Santos... I can't...
That's just another part of the price to pay.
No.
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Actually... I just want to go home.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Because... because...
Just go around him.
Kidnapped? By who?
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
He was never able to reproduce them.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
Excuse me?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Relax, Vernon...
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Sure.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Sounds like a good one.
This is worth it.
I had to. Didn't I?
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Yes.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
But... ?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
But James. I mean... How long?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Your aunt?
Where's that?
Outside Scranton.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
Because of my coat?
Not you. Your talent.
I never said that.
I'm a little worried, James.
Me? Sure. Why?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Hm.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Really, Sara, I...
Would Walter really press charges?
He told me.
I said it didn't sound like you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
James is... I don't know...
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Huh?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
When?
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
It's just a city park.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's a bright sound.
I have to go.
Cop.
No.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
I count my blessings.
No you're not.
No.
Will I see you again?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Why do you think you're here?
Fuck you, Rosen!
Is this the first one?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
I want to talk about it now.
Sorry.
I don't know.
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
I'm relaxed.
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where are you?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
This is garbage!
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
How many girls did you molest?
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
I was always the one seduced.
Being here, with me.
Maybe you should be.
Who doesn't?
That's not what I meant.
Fine.
What's it look like?
I need a shower.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
No.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
It's trying to communicate.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
Who then?
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Missed what?
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Copy that.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's the timer set for?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
No, Dad, it isn't.
Four or five days.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
That must be Basiluzzo.
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Then why do you say them?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
What! Get married?
No reason why...
Tell me once more.
It was futile. We went all over.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
To the shark.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
But why all nudes?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
What is it?
You men are all so dreadful!
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
What other boat?
Unfortunately, no.
And do you remember where she got off?
You know, I don't love anybody.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Is that possible?
Through someone else?
Who?
No.
Agnes...
But she watches... she listens.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
No.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
It's not my time of month.
I just heard you.
Let's talk about something else.
I love you.
Oh, I know he does.
I went to my room.
The baby they made up.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Agnes...
Not at the moment, no.
Why do you smoke?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
I could never be a mother.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Is that what she said?
Not my fault.
And you're unhappy.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
And then...
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
No.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Sister Marguerite I think.
What do you feel?
What do you do?
No... don't hit me please...
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
Agnes... Agnes...
Not your fault...
Yes.
Thanks...
I don't know.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
You have proof?
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Who are you?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Was there a priest?
Could there have been anyone else?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
The Catholic Church...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
Then help her.
Oh, some time in January.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What sheets?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Nothing...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Long, thin and filtered.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Of course.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
You're what?
Somebody told her.
Shurrup!
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
They'll be here.
Grotty?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Get him out of here!!
You crawler.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Oh aye, a sledge.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And cunning.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Have they?
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
What are they saying?
Eh?
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Don't be callous.
Like what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
I'm not, no.
Oh you do, look.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Oh, leave off!!!
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
But John hasn't got any.
What?
That's what I'm going to do.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
But functioning.
Sure.
Can you see anything in the hole?
Don't you remember?
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
What?
Why, what's wrong?
I kind of like it.
Well we better do something.
Boy, that's terrific.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
How's Broussard?
I can't, the acid will pour out!
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
Okay.
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Engine room, what happened?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Where are you?
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Who gets the privilege?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
Too many.
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Has anybody talked to them?
But...
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
Auto-shop?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
What is that?
How many... how many people are missing?
What?  Why?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
Check out the tent.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Give me a yell is something happens.
And what is your name?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
You know me better than that.
What else?
You sat and talked until it was light...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Yes, you did. You still do.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
That's not true!
Yes, Addison.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you two must have a long talk-
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
This is Eve Harrington.
I'll try.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
As of this moment you're six years old...
Then you're crazy.
When - when are you coming back?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
What?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
Cut it out.
I thought you were going to be late-
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Now don't get carried away-
I've been aware of that for some time.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
A cowboy.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
Also Addison deWitt.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
You don't like Eve, do you?
Why not?
Late for what?
How long does it take?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Try...
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
You won't forget it?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Over my dead body...
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Thank you, Karen.
Not at all...
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
I wouldn't like.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
The heave-ho.
Three or four miles...
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Well...
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
You'll be there, won't you.
Easy, now...
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
What is?
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
Nothing...
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Margo, you haven't got any age.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--see?--
And?--And?--
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
'68.
You voted for him.
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
How high up, which Republicans?
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
We're inside the White House now.
Haldeman.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
--Teddy Kennedy?
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
By "they" you mean...?
Tell that to Muskie.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
Can't help you.
We've just been talking to Young--
FBI too?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
No games, Irwin; give.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
So?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Are you implying you don't believe me?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Howard Hunt here.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Good God!
Security consultant.
The C.I.A.
--I'm Woodward.
I think so.
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
It is.
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
--go over your sources again--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Of course--everything they asked--
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Suck me...beautiful?
Like what?
I'm not good in math.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Single malt?
No idea.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Onions?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
...yeah.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
Then don't.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Sure.
No you haven't.
Yeah, that's right.
Right.  That gives us...
He's going in!
Holy shit!
Nothing!
These are for you.  From father to son.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Highly, highly overrated.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
I told you.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Okay!
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
For me?
Um...okay...
Tonight?
I think "shithead" really says it.
Just a second!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I think we're falling in love.
Shut the fuck up.
Also like sex with my wife.
But you better hurry.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Yeah. Apparently.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Andy! No!
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
Andy...
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
You'll never get the chance.
And you call me a moron...
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Looks like he lied to you too.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Why the fuck would I do that?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
You fucking liar!
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I know, but I had to because . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
You'll laugh.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I was all out of dynamite!
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Now just get off the train.
No!
The dessert fork!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
I'm sorry.
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I'm glad you	did too.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Watch me.
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
I should go
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
All the good meetings are taken.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Why not?
It's okay.
Alvy.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Wisconsin.
Oh, you do?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
And I love what you're wearin'.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Your grammy!
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Fifteen years, huh?
Oh, thank you.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Okay.
Good? I was-
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
M'hm.
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
M'hm.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
I dunno.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Were you always funny?
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
I didn't follow you!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Who cares? Who cares?
David? You call your teacher David?
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
Sinatra?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Will it change your wife?
Life. I said, "life."
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oh.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh. What?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Oh, darn it.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
What thing?
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Thanks, honey.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Yeah.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
The what?
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Yeah.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Just give me the license, please.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
What difference does that make?
How do you like this couple, Max?
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Very well.
To code?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Would it make a difference?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
I'm in mourning.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Borrow whatever you like.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
He's not going tonight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Damn straight.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Can I open it?
Sally?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Oh, very jealous.
Well it's fucking time.
Let me heal you, baby.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
I don't think so.
I adore him.
I'm ready.
For good.
Truce.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis!!!!
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
It's a novel.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Don't.
You don't have to.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
That's under lock and key.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Yes.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Ah.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
I will treasure this.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
What am I, five?
A lot of cakes.
Sorry?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
I so wish I'd known.
Do you need anything else?
The charades.
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Okay.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
I guess.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Evie has a little something for you.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Hm.
It's much more personal in here.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
Oh Soph...
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Tell me about it.
Invisible!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
So what makes you so special?
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
You held onto this all that time?
Don't get all sappy about it!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Why are we so successful?
...Ants...
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
What do I do?
I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Sheldrake?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Oh.
I think so.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Sure.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Too slow?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You really think so?
You are?
Do I have to?
Sure.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
Over a girl?
Might as well go all the way.
The dishes?
What?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I never thought he'd do it.
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Last night?
I don't know.
You better.
I'm not through with you yet.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Relax, Baxter.
You too, sir.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
What?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do you want?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Slow down, kid.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Who is Mickey?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
I'm with you, lover.
Good night?
My shoes.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Dreyfuss.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You're not being funny.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Merry Christmas.
The nerve.
I told you -- with my mother.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
See if they'll what?
Oh -- oh!
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Part.
I was an FO for the 25th.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
Who are you ?
How?
Yeah, it is.
Not a thing.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Yeah -- like keep out --
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Touchy.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Yeah.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Wh -- what?
You want'a surf, soldier?
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Music?
I'm Kurtz.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
You know you're right.
No water.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I was on threshold of great things.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Yeah... thanks.
Sure.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Yes.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Well , who's in command here?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
150  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:  
How did she..?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
A daughter in Oregon.
Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
You got one?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.

You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
But I would.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
We were just talking about him.
I love you.
Not bad.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
What's with the dark?
Yes.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
What needs clearing up?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Now I want you to do something for me.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Two days.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Okay.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I'll take a bus.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Cute.
What job?
Because...
Okay.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Uh-huh...
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
About a dog.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
What's he look like?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Get out.
Now we'll both call him.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Just a second -- he has to go.
No.  No I'm not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Probably.
Just do your job.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
What?
What?
Do you want Rath or not?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
$1,000,000.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Turn off the engine.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
'Them'?
Until a minute ago.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's not the same, is it?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
No, they didn't.
They tried to kill you?
They become complicated... messy.
No.  Something honest.
Okay.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
What happened?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
No?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Yes.
Why?  I don't know.
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
What happened to her?
Did you --
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm not normal.
Martin.
Right.
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
That's exactly what I told myself.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Can I ask you a question?
American currency.
This will take some time.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
What did the beer cost?
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
So?
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Tough break.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Like helping a sick kid?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Why don't we go together?
No, We aren't going to do it.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
That bad?
They ain't the only ones.
Damn!
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Yeah, maybe.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
You're everything a guy could want.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
Look, just hear me out, okay?
But we could go to London and live in England.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Good, great....Dobchay!
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
A champion of lost causes huh?
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Why don't we both forget about him?
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
Yeah.
But I have to finish this....
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Well come on, sit down.
We're not sure...
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
I do.
Why not?
-- I like the car I have.
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
I meant he's a doctor.
That'd be something.
I'm just wondering --
And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
You.
You don't know me.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
This play -- ?
Maybe a little of both.
Don't bother!
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
No.
I'm really glad you think so.
No.
What are you talking about?
Fun.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
You planned this --
No. Why? Are you seducible?
What about your father?
That what you do?
What are you going to -- ?
I will.
He wants help with his lines --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
You decide.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
For pay?
You're welcome.
A similar triangle?
What do you want, Biff?
Yes, sir!
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Good.
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Marty.
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Not bad.
She plays the clarinet, too.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
I used to throw trash for the City.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Mmmmm.
Sure.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
What're you doing?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
I don't know.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
What for?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Yeah.
It's your play.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
I can look and see.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Excuse me.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Yes.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Fine.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Hold it right there.
Planet 10?
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
To get my guns.
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Everybody okay up here?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Who?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
No, I don't.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
She was killed, Penny.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
It's too dangerous.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Should we be on Code Red?
I didn't drop 'em.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Why me?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Drown all those rascals...
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
A souse!
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
No, what did it say?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Seen a doctor?
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Ready... wrestle!
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Where there's life there's hope.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Hold on –
Hold on –
I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
And then... well...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
Transient or resident?
Uh-huh.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
All night?
Were you drinking?
How about the coke?
No.
Catherine Tramell.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
I don't smoke.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
Thanks.
You know all about me.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I like you.
Do you?
Don't get too cocky.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
To see if I can get away with it.
I'll convince you.
Did you?  What's she doing?
Did you miss me?
What are you researching?
How did it end?
I told you.  She kills him.
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Thanks.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I don't know.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
We bring her in for questioning.
And you volunteered.
I'm sure.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Yes I did.
He was shot.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
What about the shit they write?
Saddle River, New York!
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Aren't they?
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
Should there be?
Who am I?
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I guess you did.
Party girls? Can I call you?
You don't have any fucking money..
You're back.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Forget it.
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar – I'll get the rest.
Me? Why?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Oh.  "Kyle."
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yes and no...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Had one.  Didn't work.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Yawn.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Eventually she married a young physician.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
Alfred's happy here.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Dear daisy, don't despair.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Our work?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
Apology hastily retracted.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
Actually, he took the car.
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Just checking, young sir.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
On occasion. Usually at night.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
What? This isn't normal?
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
...Not the bat?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
I don't think so.
What say we flip for it?
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
... Very good, sir.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Shouldn't we --
... A hundred and eight?
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
... Where are you taking me?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is it you want?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
... Looks like a convention.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
I feel naked without it.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
What are you, scared of heights?
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
I said I'd check with you.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
David, I'm serious!
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Thanks, Annie.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Great news.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first?
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
Uh...
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Um... ass... head...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cut the power!
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
We're rich in what really matters.
Almost.
Adam!
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
What about this Beetle guy?
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Little black party dresses?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Of course you do.
Good girrrl!
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Why not?
Stepmother's...
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Viridian?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
... Mentor...?
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
How is Ben feeling?
I see.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes, very well, thank you.
I see.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
I certainly do.
... I see.
I agree.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Yes.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Yes.
... Good evening, Louise.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Clearly, yes comrade.
No, sir.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Oh? What?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
Thank you, Colonel.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish
Hmmm.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Shut up!
It'll never happen, fuckface.
You came up here looking for the portal?
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I know.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
I said "yes."
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yeah.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Maxine.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
My God.
I've fallen in love.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
A scary dream?
I like that.
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Oh, be still my heart.
No you mustn't, my child.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Yeah, I saw them
Mr. Malkovich?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
How'd you get this number?
Oh, Lotte...
What the fuck is going on?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
You've got to be kidding.
Derek Mantini!
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You on your way home?
You grown.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Mama?
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I don't know him that well.
It's her, ain't it?
You was friends.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
She was only-
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Oh, nothin', you know.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Yeah, it sucks.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
I was bowling--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Uh-huh.
He's handicapped, huh?
Far out.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Heh-heh--
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
What's your drink, Dude?
Yeah man.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Oh, no.
No it's fine, really, uh--
The main guy, Dieter--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Maude?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
What the fuck are you--
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
What the fuck is going on there?
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Uzi?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
But Walter--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Yeah.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this your homework, Larry?
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
Shit yeah!
Come on, Walter!.
They shot Donny!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
WHAT?!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Someday.
Minutes.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Scud.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
There are other ways to see. Sit.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Show me.
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Preventive medicine.
You don't know that.
Like me.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
Then what is it?
What about the chemistry panel?
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
How?
Hey, folklore--
Inside the grave?
Sometimes. Where are we going?
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Something was wrong.
The Witch's voice.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
--whatever; that's her.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--bullshit!
--Cotter's--
Sleep.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
The, uh, blur there.
I want amphetamines.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
Butt-ugly owl.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Gimme it!
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
The wheel.
Fine.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
--it's less than four feet, just--
What?
--and we brought it back with us!
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
That's why she kills children.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
Anna--
Does she, goddamnit??
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
Who <u>is</u> this??
I am?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Sort of...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell happened, Ray?
Marty.
I don't follow baseball.
Lubbock?
Uh-huh.
I told you. I like you.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
Well what?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
How would I know?
What.
Don't throw that out.
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Okay honey.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
It must be great.
Yeah.
. my bourbon.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Yes.
Lie down on the bed.
Sure I'm alright. 
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my breasts?  . See?
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. please. I won't.
Do you know?
O.K.
. same here.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Please. please stay.
Hello.
Yes. Frank-
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
No. it's not Don.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
Dorothy. no!
You called me Jeffrey.
They hurt his head.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What?
Terrible. boring.
Maybe so.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
This is not my usual Friday night!
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
No.
Okay. great!
Really?
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Hey Jeff.
Good deal Dad.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Do you want the car?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
That sounds great!
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
What?
Yeah.  I am.
Are you kidding?
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
We want some grass.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
It's your grass.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
What?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
You fucked me, Diego.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Mom.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Why are you smiling?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
But this is...
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I know, Dad.  I know...
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Who's the co-pilot?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Stoned?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
Which "district" do you belong to?
What "group"?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
Then don't complain.
Sure ...
I think it'll be a success ...
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
To show them to the UN, right?
Let's hope forever.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Did I say it was a natural death?
What induced it?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Could you be more specific?
No -- never.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Yeah.
We were lovers.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
What happened after that?
No.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Yes.
Chinese peony root.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Did he make your life miserable?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
No.
Why'd you come here?
No.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
That's not an answer.
Tastes can change.
It won't be that hard.
Really?
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You're a monster.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Why did you lie to me?
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Please -- not now.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Daddy -- stop it!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Carolyn!
She changed.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Oh. When did you move back?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Yeah.
Sure.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
What's he like?
And clean.
I feel so embarrassed.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
You sound like an artist.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Francesca?
Woman friends, too?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
Do you want to leave your husband?
No. I was just... No.
Wonderful. Uh...
Oh, sure. Great.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Sure.
What?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Near the church.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
No. I couldn't.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
I don't.
How the hell should I know?
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Just some flies.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
Hush, baby.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You know I can't.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Mother!  No.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
And you believe her?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
You was just doing your job.
Now you.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
It was just like in my head.
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
You want to get into this now?
Where is it?
Stay away!
Give it to me.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
What are you talking about?
But you know he did it.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What happened to them?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Who are you going to call?
Shut up, Violet.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
Sure, Gino, sure.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Good idea.
Five.
Lick me.
I could be lying.
Are you okay, Violet?
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
We're not that different, Corky.
Because it's the truth.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
I think so, too.
Yes.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
I am, but ...
Good.
Yeah.
He does it right in front of him.
I'm here, aren't I?
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
I don't know what we're talking about.
Yes.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
I want a second opinion.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Why?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Paris?
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
Yes.  Is he there?
Okay.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
What does that mean?
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
We're about an hour away.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
That's it?  Is that it?
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
It's a company... MPG Capital.

If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
I can't protect you anymore.
You have ID?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
So get the hell out of here.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- here we go -- I found it --
He run away often?
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
Hang on... 
I tried.
All of them?
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
I told you.  You need to rest.
I fixed it myself.
...sabotage!
... yer ducts.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Her name is Jill.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Jack!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Layton! Oh shit!
How much do you know?
Not much.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
So how ...?
What has Tuttle done?
He's a freelance subversive?
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
Very smart.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Where are you taking me?
Really.
Turn around!
Who will?
We? Don't blame me!
Leave me alone!
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Oh ... Jesus!
Yes.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Would you really, Sam?
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
27156789/074328/K.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sam Lowry.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
You remember Samuel, my son.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
What is it?
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
But ... I called Central Services.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
No. Wait here.
It's a miracle.
No underwear?
I know him. That's Noel.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Did you see my father?
She should go home.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Thanks.
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
You learn that in the army?
Frank!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Yeah.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
What?
No?
Oh, God, no!
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
London.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Okay.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
A half hour in the lobby.
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Of course.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
As good as humanly possible.
Yes.
Okay, great -- good luck.
No.
No.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
I have to be somewhere.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Really?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Thanks.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Yes?
He said something about...
Just a two-second dissolve.
Okay, sweetie.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
I don't write.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Okay.
Yes.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
Yeah?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Where are you?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
That's yes?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
A picnic?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
What did he do?
Righto.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
There there...
Thank you.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Sure!
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Well, w-what did you do?
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Uh, sure.
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Yes, get rid of them...
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Here here!
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
If you see him.
I was just straightening up the place.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
You think?  Split?
Let me in.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
I'm fine.
Yes.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
You weren't home.  Like always.
Is that your car?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
You want some water or something?
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm glad you came.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
I have cheerleading squad.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
I guess.
What's happening?  What do you want?
My parents have money...
Swear to God.
Why?  Why me?
I don't understand.
You think so?
But --
Well, I hope so.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Except for Prom.
Run.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
What?
Catch?
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
It's all the same thing.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I did.
I don't dance.
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
G'night.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
So...Wanta make love?
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
I want you desperately!
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
No.
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
Praise the Lord, eh?
You need a nickname.
Oh both of you, of course...
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Who's he play for?
Did you call me a cocksucker?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
You're the boss.
Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
No way.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
It's a league record.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
We're eight and sixteen.
...and one helluva guy.
It's a damn convention.
Looking for Crash Davis.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
Yes, you were.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
But what happens when they do find out?
You got it.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Congratulations.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Right back.
Matter of fact...
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Between...
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
...very difficult to get in.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Well...
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Yeah, she's here.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Ace, listen to me.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Certainly.  Senator.
Right away. Okay?
Hey, Mitch.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Oh, fabulous.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
Why do you need that much?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You can trust me.
Yeah, how do I know?
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Listen...
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Pretty serious.
It's under...
Okay?
Yeah.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
I put her to bed.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
With Jennifer.
What'd you have?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me.
I wouldn't do that...
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Eight children! 
Mr Rothstein.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I really think you're -
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Can't do it with both hands?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You shut up.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
And here. Here.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
You've gotta be kidding me! 
I did - I didn't -
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Is that the last one?
Fuckers!
I'm over here now.
Calm down! Calm down!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
How are you?
Fine, fine.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
He gives a fuck what I do?
Yeah.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I don't - 
Yeah?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
I love you.
Here.
He called you right here.
No, I'm gonna drive.
Listen...
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Why?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Charlie M.
Yeah.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Take it easy, though.
You are right. What can I...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
I wonder..
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What did you think?
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
You've seen me...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
I'll let you know.
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
Thanks.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Taking messages.
Why would I do that?
Can you make him stop!
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Not this minute.
You don't understand.
Will you let me explain!
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
My name is --
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Shit!
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Tell me what she looks like.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
A woman?
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
That's not her.
Black Mercedes, 600S.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
I can't do it.
You're going to let them get away with this?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
You're enjoying this too much.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
They did some great job of reforming you.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
What's your point?
Naturally.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Pass.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't know what you mean.
You should've done all this before.
And not a nickel.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Better reassure him.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Five minutes.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
How?
What would you call it?
Jimmy.
Fucking mad!
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
Whatever it is she does for you.
Nothing.
What was that all about?
What look?
The one you gave me in the Metro.
They're jealous.
That's good...
What do you think?
He did sometimes.
Yeah.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
All the time.
Where?
So they do know.
No. Can't pretend that much.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Kind of.
She from Scotland too?
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
I promise.
Jimmy?
He asked me to see were you all right.
You do?
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Can't.
I know.
So you did fuck up.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
So?
It's your decision.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Would make me feel better about it.
I know that.
Definitely unusual.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
No fucking way.
So I've noticed.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.
What?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
Tree.
Shut up, would you?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Don't be so sure.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
You liked her?
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
A story.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
People. They could be looking.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
What about it?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
You're going to look for him -- now?
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
I love you, Adam.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Agents.
What's your first name today?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
No.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Open it.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
You can't.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Cutting it out.
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
I'm sorry.
Alex --
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
No -- not yet.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
And the last one?
Not unless we're blind.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Tell me what?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Where did he keep his money?
I know.  I'm sorry.
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that all? Can I go now?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
What should we give him?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Yes.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
What was it?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
I don't understa--
But what?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
He took care of Charlie for us.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
As fucking if.
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
Ok!
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She just turned off her light.
Did you warn her?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What?
I'm sure you should have failed.
You're the killed.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You think you're my sister?
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
NO?!
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
They're not picking me up until six.
Did he say anything else about her?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Why not?
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
The principal?
Who was the fourth?
Just thinking about something.
No.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Yes. Unfair to me.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
...Darlene pay you in cash?

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Hang on.  Hang on.
...truck.
I got, uh....
...doing?!
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Are you kiddin'?
...all the time.
You'd better coast through...
Oh, man.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
God-...
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Okay. 
Shut up.
Take your gun!
Oh...
 Nice job back there.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

All right, you got it.
That's right.  Now,  move!

Oh, shit.
...easy, easy, easy.
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Pete.  Come on.
Ho, ho...
...ho!
 Go, go.
No.  Shit.
Yeah...
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Oh, no!


We were nationally  ranked.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.

...miles.
 Whoo!
Even though it is nice to see Andy...

Huh?
We're gonna die!
Arlo!  Arlo.

Go!
...on!
You've gotta be...
Forty-nine point four.


Okay.  Come on, big guy!

Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!

I feel faint.
That's right.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
And it won't be pleasant. 
...such is the price...of patriotism.
...help you?
You-You can't let him...

We've got it...

...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
Mm-hm.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
"Went away."  I like that.
Forget about him.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY.
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Assumptions are always...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
...never done a thing for you?



Be sure you feed Bosco.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Secrets.
Go.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
I will tell you what I...
...-son.
...and that power...
...is death.
Everything will die, Mason.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
I'm at mile marker...
Do you recognize this young man?
Got that?
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
That's not the way I...
...beer.
...stole a truck under arrest.
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
Don't move!

Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
EXT. U.S. ARMY RESEARCH LABORATORY/GUARD GATE - JEROME - NIGHT.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY. 
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
That's right.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
It doesn't hurt.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
They're calling it an accident.
Do you know him?
Where from?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
His girlfriend?
No. She's probably scared to death.
When was the last time?
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Curly, where's your car?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
You sure this is okay?
I said okay, Jake.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Summer colds are the worst.
I get by.
Since when?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Yes.
A private investigator?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Oh... thank you.
But he wasn't killed.
Why?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Oh.
Over the water department, or over you?
Never forgave him for what?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
And I want to know where.
He owns it. You know?
This morning.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Katherine.
...where does Kyo live?
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Help yourself.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Si.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Water and Power?
He did or he didn't?
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
What about?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
But you don't have any kids!!!
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 
Then why don't you change jobs? 
No...
Come in, Alfredo.
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Yes. 
No. And nobody knows where she is.
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
We'll talk about that later.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
Where is he?
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I'll write it myself.
Look at that.
Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
That's a long story.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who else you been to see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Certainly not.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Is it good?
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
What's the matter with you?
Hmm!
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
Do you know what that is?
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
I mean I've got a job for you.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
What check?
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
You won't be lonely, Charles...
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Hey, Nurse!
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Queer?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Think again!
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
I think you'd better leave now.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Can I watch?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Awww. That was so cute.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Well... kind of, sort of?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You lie.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Let me take you out tonight.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Who doesn't?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.
That's what I said.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Nudie booth?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
Which ones?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Why'd you apologize?
I don't back down.
At least we're stuck here together.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Can we not talk about this?
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
You've had sex with a dead person.
You hardly knew her!
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
I don't want to talk to you.
What?
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
No way!
You're happy?
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
You're a snake.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Yes.
Just the paper.
I don't have love handles.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
I don't know.
Yeah.
No, she's getting married.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
I should start.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
She's my girlfriend.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Why do you say that?
And I actually date you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
Including you; yes.
Why do you say that?
Please calm down.
How many?
This is different. This is important. How many?!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
And that made you feel better?
...it isn't there. Yes.
What're you talking about?
A couple...?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Randal...?
It stings a little.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
Well, how about these two movies? 
You hope what feels good?
I'm not sad.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Which one?
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
All right, asshole, you're on.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Fuck you.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
So, what do you see?
I love you, too.
There wasn't time for anything else.
Oh, please.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Why are you yelling?
Resuscitation?
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
Jess--you look good.
Hal knows what he's doing.
What if he can't?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Call me sentimental.
It was great.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Jess, c'mon...
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
What about you?
Take the rope.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Then go fetch.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
I've been cured.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
I beg your pardon?
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Well, how are you then?
Aye.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
Murder, sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
Prison custody?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sixth is faster.
You got a deal.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
You psychic?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Jesus...
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Very generous.
This isn't our goddamn game!
Try?
Of course!
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I'm standing right here.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
You mean like benefits?
Why not?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
No.  You say you're cool.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
South Central.
How long, you figure?
You said you were visiting friends!
Yes.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Who was he?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Yes, Max?
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Who?
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
No, not just that.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
And you believe me...?
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Vincent?
Who?
Drop me off here!
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Really?
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
Do they have a secret handshake?
I have no idea.
You're certifiable.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Surprise me.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
I've been reading up on it.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Shoot.
Is he dead?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
A water main broke.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You will?
Jerry, I --
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
At a horse show.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
You do?
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Without a love of my own.
Don't do this.
I'm leaning toward no.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Whatever.
Excuse me?
You've asked me that one three times.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
It was.  It was.
Agent Lowry?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Yeah, I do.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
I don't think so.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
No doubt.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
Are you threatening me?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Well --
Because I can't.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
The systems integration site.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
That's what they all say.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
-- I'm moving to Washington.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
You too.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Spoken like a true believer.
How do you mean?
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Can you try?
Prove it.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
It's getting late...
How do you mean?
Oh.  I brought you something.
What are you so afraid of?
I can't hear this now --
It was quite a page turner.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
You steal a car?
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
You don't know!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Tramp! Beautiful!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
I call.
What happened? How far did you get?
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Thass right. Just play it...
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Cuter again.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
What are you talking about?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
None of your fucking business.
What did I do?
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
I thought he was lying.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I think this is number three...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
I know, baby.  I know.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Yeah, everything's different.
Look at him, grandstanding...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
You're damn right I do.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
What the hell you need her for?
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Did you come?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
Not yet. It's only beginning.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I want to see my mother immediately.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Please, Letty.
What about the engagement party?
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
What's the matter?
It'll be fine.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
I can't.    I can't see him there.
Will you get time off to do that?
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
When did you start smoking?
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
I wasn't hungry.
I do.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Yeah.    How was the job search?
I couldn't even face that one.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
It's hard to know where to start.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
No, no.
Who?
What?
You killed her!
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
It's Daniel.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
I'm good.   Really.
-- Super what?
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
But you were there?
I guess we're going to find out.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Where are you staying?
No problem.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Cops?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
What about the money?
No.   Chicks dig me.
We have to find Sophie.
Don't bullshit me.
Why haven't you turned us in?
We had a deal.
You said don't do it, boss.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Yeah, I can see that.
Me?
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Get in the car.
Yeah.   It's mine.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Wait here.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Glenmorangie.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
Don't bother.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
How so?
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
You know about Lo?
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Only the sword will settle this.
Kneel!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Give it back!
Yes.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
What was it?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Have you questioned him yet?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Care for a hot dog?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
You're welcome.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
Fun -- look at that guy...
No.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
Magic.
Leave me alone -- !
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Kill a dead guy?
No shooting.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
You did?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Why not?
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
And you promise to abide by it?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Good for you.
It was perfect.
Why aren't you understanding?
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
That's great.
It was nothing.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Did you hide the letters?
Does your mother know?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Well what then?
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
I want to go home.
I'm sorry.
I know.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Yes!
Yes!
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
It would feel so yummy.
I'm working on it.
Call me later.
Okay.
No.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
So? How'd it go last night?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Come again?
That's beautiful.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Annette! Annette!
I understand. Good night.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
You bastard!
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
Are they nice?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Yes, darling,
What?
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
You do that, Edward.
I live right here.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
It was just a voice.
Let me be the judge of that.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
You called me by my name.
But where do you come from?
Will you be friend for always?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Of course,
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
A lady threw it to me.
But she's such a nice lady.
Who is she?
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Good. Except for PMS.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
And he was missing an arm.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Okay, I gotta go.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Hide him.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Fall in love.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
No. I won't let you do that.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Sure. See ya.
So you're Grant's secretary?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
I'm working on it...
On your desk.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No.
Very well then. Is that all?
Oh, it's nothing.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm sorry.
Like what?
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Okay, you busted me.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
I love you too.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
You got a dog?
She's just so... pathetic.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
He tried to kill me!
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Iím sorry...
Well be more careful, please.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Not that.  Anything else.
Wait, this isn't fair...
You seem restless.
Shut up!
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
I'm nothing then.
I'm...  being...  punished.
How do you know I'm innocent?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
You're kidding?
Well it's a last minute change.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Oh.  Fine.
Are you threatening me?
And who's gonna find out?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
I see what you mean.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
What?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
I can't say.
Yeah.
What about it?
Well...
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
I guess.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I know.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Fabulous.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
Tonight?
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
Curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
Come on!
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
Oh, I have no doubt.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I don't think they're in school.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
All right.  I'll second that.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Yes sir.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A barbaric yawp.
AHHHHHH!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A crazy madman.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I'm calling her!
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
What is it?
I don't.
I guess.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Quiet.  I have to think.
It's my birthday.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh..
Oh. 
How do we get out of here?
What the hell are you talking about?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
And no questions asked.
How soon can we get up and running?
Dead.
Who asked you to!
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Yeah you did...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
A meat locker.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
And what if I run into one of those things?
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
I have been.
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Someone's back there.
I mean let's get going before --
Who's going?
We're all going.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Jesus, it's freezing!
I know, but...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
I know! I fuckin' know!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
Where is he???
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
No.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Psst. Vince!
Oh, Jesus.
Biederman, yes.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh, it's great. Fine.
You're going hunting?
I see you're going hunting.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
And then you...
I want to go home, Merle.
There's Vince!
Yeah.
What do you think about?
I thought you might be praying.
More bullets in the gun?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Here! This is it!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
Where?
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Give it to me.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
We have to talk.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
I got it.  I got it.
Nobody's looking.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
What else did he get?
...Have you been drinking?
And you should be with your family.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
And what about Daniel Webster?
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
That's just too bad --
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Sure am.
Black Dan'l?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
She couldn't be gone!
No, Stone!
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
No, you're not.
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
I do -- and I think you should too.
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
My time isn't up yet.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
You know darn well it is.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
Your butter money?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Oh -- Jabez.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
All right, Jabez ...
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
Mind if I play some tunes?
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Go fuck yourself.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Yessir.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Heidi, I'm dying.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  So how are you?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Look... who's on the phone?
Are they on the phone still?
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
What do you want?
Sonny, come on out!
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
He's all doped up.
I don't know.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Because I don't want cancer.
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
What?
... The bodies out the door.
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
We won't have to.
I'm here.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
I am.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Yeah - it looks real official.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Oh.  Run.
Robbing a bank.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
You're news, Sonny ...
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
What?
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
Nice to see you again, Edna.
PROVE IT!
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
He said... take his right arm.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
I be.  I'm living large.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
We're still standing.
That's it.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
What responsibilities?
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
How are you holding up in this weather?
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Motherfucker you.
Fuck!  My money!
That's my name.
Do I have to spell it out?
Him no white.  Him no white.
Talk to your son.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Do we now?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Mookie?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
When?
Hot.  Hot.
How long then?
What else?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Why you gotta curse?
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
What?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
Sez who?
Sez me.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
I'm listening.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
How do you know this?
So what do you want me to do?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Tell Vito.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Actually we have something for you.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Gotcha.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Coming.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
So boys, how was your first day?
Me too!
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Me too!
The principal.
Wow.
Oh, is this your special place?
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
She did not.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
The answer is George Jefferson.
You certainly did.
Am not.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
What?
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Can you believe it?
Uh-oh. Harry?
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
It's a surprise.
Everything. Just for the record.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
This is my son, Paul.
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not sorry enough.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Where are we do you think?
Is he....?
He knows.
Why do they come?
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Those sounds could be imitated.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Do you want me to get it for you?
I don't understand.
That's good.  I could use the money.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Dracula?
Let me take you to the hospital.
I don't know how to make goulash.
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Eddie, you screwed up.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Rolling.
This is the big moment...!
And who may you be?
You got the job?!!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Better than not getting a job?
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Toss us out on our ass.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
That's not true --
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
I like to think so.
Yes?
Da pleasure be mine.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
So you're not a fruit?
Isn't he dead?
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
I am.  How's your father?
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Uh, atomic energy?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Dynamite --
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Huh?!
Yes?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Yes!
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Mr. Wood!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
What if--you're vomiting?
Where is she? Is she all right?
What?!
What?
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Right.
Oh.
He made a mistake.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
But Al is your husband now!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
No.
What are you talking about?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Saturday, I think we should
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
There's a list.
I'm sorry.
Come on...
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
The what?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
I'm doing all right.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Oh, Jesus.
Great.
You watching the ballgame?
Hi, Shari.
Oh, man! So...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
In love?
He likes it.
Yeah, just --
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
As far as I know, they--
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Uh, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
I have proof.
Here?
Yep.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
And 290 "disregards," right?
I know.
I don't care.
Well, I do.
For what?
Thanks!
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
That obvious, huh?
Yes.  But do you know?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Yeah.  But not for long.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
So tell me about it.
Captain, what do you want?
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Of course...
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Until he gunned down six people.
I don't have time.  I have --
Believed what?
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
The youngest applicant by eight years.
And now you'll provide them.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Lynn Bracken.
Not good enough.
Really?  What did White say?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Under the house.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Around.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You're crazy.
Wait. What do I do?
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
One-twenty.
You told me no calls.
I didn't use my name.
I was a traffic analyst.
Them.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
No he won't.
So what do we do now?
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
Not particularly, no.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Are you sure about this?
Anytime.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Why?
Thanks.  Who are you?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
No, sir.
Not a very good one, but--
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Have you been working with Rachel?
Sorry.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
That was for Christmas.
Why the hell would I--
When do I get to meet him?
What answer were you--
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
You're not.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
Will you hang on just a second.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Tell me about Brill.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
It's not me?
Shut the fuck up.
Good point.
She can't talk to you right now.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Rachel's dead?
I don't know. I mean--
To the cops?
I have a family.
Yeah?
Jerry?
Are you still in Crystal City?
I don't know.
Get it.
What the hell does it mean?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
No thank you.
Then let's assume I don't.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Her or me?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Oh my God, the others!
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Will you please come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
This is empty, just coming!
Don't go over it again, please.
No.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
In my room.
Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
When's Clifton picking you up?
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Rabbit hunting.
What if I told you he did this to me?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Oh really?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Yes.  Dropping off.
He's Canadian.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
That's a different dress.
Is something funny?
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
You get Hardy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Of course.  When?
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
The windows don't open.
We're getting close.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I have a proposal for you.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I sincerely hope so.
Give him the card.
I never carry...baggage.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
It was perfect.
No. It's a down payment.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Little celebration before we set off.
You were afraid of heights?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Behind you.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
I'd taken the Mask?
The eight billion. From them to us.
A parting gift from the Empire.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
I'm not leaving without you.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
What about you?
Which is--
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Black of course.
You damn well thought wrong.
You know where my loyalties lie.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
They did?
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
Excuse me?
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
What, you think I'm made of money?
Erin --
It's not about working hard --
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
You think there's more?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Show me the document that proves that.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
What?  Who?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Here what comes?
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Ross.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
You got a little girl?
How?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Right.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna clean it up.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Nothing.
I didn't say that.
Lock the door.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
Yes?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
Ben ... Ben ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
Right.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Han, we need you here.
We?
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Good.
How do I look?
Beautiful.
Would you please stop calling me that?
I do not!
Try and control this ...
No lightspeed?
Can you trust him?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
No.
Thanks.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
I didn't say anything?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Only what you take with you.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
And I too.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
A display of primitive apparatus --
With food?
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Somebody get off!
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Call me Snake.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
A medical team will be standing by.
The name's Plissken.
Does he know how to activate it?
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Who ain't?
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
...Perceval!
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
But not from your destiny.
What's this, what's this?!
...of course...
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
What is this place, Merlin?
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Your mother told you that?
You freed it, son?
Not you, my husband?
And you cannot love me...
There is one.
We are to blame.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
I didn't know that.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
I see, your excellency.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
No kidding.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Of course I didn't.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
What!
What man?
Lies?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Are you sure?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
What kind of stuff?
When can I have one?
Where?
Captain who?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Oh I love you.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
That's good.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
How's the girl?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Good bye.
Sure.
Who's in it?
Another one. Had your lunch?
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
You and us.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
But deliver us from the evil one.
And also with you.
And also with you.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
What's this about?
Only what I read in the papers.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him!!!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
How old are you?
Who is it?
It's my goddamn car!
It's all there.  Both nights.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
How many?
No bones.
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
How we doing?
Lotta water.
Huh?
Jack...
Try the black Knable.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's more than that.
This time you gotta go.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
Frank?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
No?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Talk.
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I didn't get her number.
I'll drop the eighths.
It's early.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Yeah, fine.
So what do you think?
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Day.  Wednesday.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
A few bars!
Okay.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Christ, can't you hear it?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
He was wearing a suit.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I don't know.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
I'm sorry?
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Well, that's fine --
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Where's my name?
Nine?
Hey!
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
I'll call you.
Job.
Will I see you again?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Yeah.
The name's Baker --
Downstairs.
Frank works hard.
Is that the way it is?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You want me to walk you?
Every year.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
How do you know?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
You're kidding.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Oh.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
We outgrew each other.
Yeah.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Sure.
He's losing his teeth.
Yeah -- me.
My place.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Or reactivated the first one.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
That's what they always say.
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Don't count on it.
Not if I kill you first ...
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
What happened?
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Excuse me?
Adelle?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
What about me?
What’s going on here?
Where’s my real dad?
Ringing my bell...
It’s not Kate, is it?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
A lucky streak, huh?
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
How much time?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Excuse me?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
It’s good, right?
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
No, open it...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
It’s wonderful...
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
Jack.
And God love you for it.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
No...I’m not...
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Baby, you're scaring me.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
And you can?  Power it up?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Sweet.
Blockhead started it!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Hilarious.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
The Other Side got to him.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
But big enough for us...
And if it should take more time to get through --
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
I feel much better now...
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
What's that?
No, there's no other way.
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
I'll do what I can.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Where's my daughter?
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I don't know. Few munce.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
We split that.
Huh?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, don't be silly.
Officer Olson.
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Brainerd?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
but do you know that for sure without -
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Sir? Right now?
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah.
Where're you going?
Ya got the car?
Yah.
Norstars.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
The heck d'ya mean?
No, see -
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Yah?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Gotta go?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah - how are you doon?
Just a Diet Coke.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
It's okay...
Nope.
Yah, is this Marge?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah.
Yah, ya think?
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden?
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
I want brain parasites.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
In case we want to switch nights.
I found a new one.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
What... ?
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Chloe's dead.
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
What?
What did you say... ?
I've done you enough favors.
What?
Tyler?
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
... You know me?
Is this part of the test?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Do what you like.
I don't follow...
What's that?
Go ahead.  Say it.
Is it?
Alive or dead?
Okay... Ghandi.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
I thought you did.
Imagine how he feels.
No.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Is this really news to you?
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You took me to the house.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
You want out?
Defuse the bomb.
I think this is about where we came in.
What?
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
What?
Maintenance.
Excuse me?
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
Robert Paulson?
Pleeeeeease!
So let's do it.
Six duds in a row.
Speed up.
Should we knock?
We need to hurry.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
That lucky bastard.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Who?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
I know how it feels to be dead.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What feeling?
That it's not over yet.
He's not a witch.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
That's him, but... he's not here.
Right. April 25th.
Most kids never have it happen.
Get out! Get out of the car!
Why do you think I was hiding?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
You stopped.
One hundred.
Exactly.
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
Forget it.
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
You think you are... .
Why me?
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Not my people.
Can you walk?
I could take it or leave it.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Yeah.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
You're all right... you sure...
Okay.  ... I love you...
You still believe in God?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where?  Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
They're --  -- What?
I'm the one what?
The Little...
Parry.
I know...
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
It's a classic.
Who are you talking to Jack?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
No just Parry.
Oh...like Moses.
I don't like horror movies!
You don't have to say that.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Divorced.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I know you're not.
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Do you love me, Bobby?
You'll be gone, period.
Who said I was depressed?
I don't know.
Washington.
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
No kidding.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Wait...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Thank you.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
I think it's what you think.
I don't think that's accurate...
What?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I'll be back later...
What?
At game, Carl.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
It's all right. I'm fine.
Not at all.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Besides being very rude.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Alright.
What are you doin' here?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You here to see somebody?
You're kidding.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
I have no idea.
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
Ask anybody.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Like when?
Like tonight.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Fletch...
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
You find the source?
Can I get you something?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Till then.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
They busted me last week.
What's that?
Twenty years.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Come inside.
I want you to murder me.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Take it where?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Here, take mine.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
He never sees them and I never met them.
What is this?
Long story.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
You saw a forgery.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I'm calling the police. Right now.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Very good, sir.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
What...
Yeah.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't know, I never met your father.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
So you...
But I am...
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Great pipes.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Contacts.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Wha --
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Say cheese...
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
'Bye, Johnny...
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
I'm clean.
Well try, okay?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
Yes --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
That's a relief.
You're for real?
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Marseilles.

Where the hell is it?
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Strike out, eh?
How'd I know he had a knife.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
We put him to bed for the night.
For garbage?
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
Nothing.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Don't know what's behind it.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Sure.
You give him his drops?
I love you more.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
About what?
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Daddy, I'm scared.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
I can't believe people are still using these things.
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
29-years ago.
I don't know.
Yeah...I think so.
Nah, I gave it up.
I lost you.
Chief?!  Is that you?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Please, Dad, just do it.
Sully!  Is that you?
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
What?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
What?
Look who's talking.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Where's Shelly?
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
Yes, man!
Chuck... look.
What?
No.  I got here just before you did.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Don't say any more.
What?  Who pulled it out?!
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Whaddya mean?
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Yeah, that's fat too.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Did you hear me?!
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Are they grown-ups?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Look, I don't want your money!
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
N...nothing.
'Night, Josh.
Get up!
Goddamnit!
That's very colorful, chief.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
He bought you that?
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Tell me.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
You're telling a lie.
But Sean said...
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
But Rennie...
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Elliot?
Shut up, Elliot.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
It's your best play, Nicky.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
Had to be him.
She was very evasive.
This could be it.
I talked to her two days ago.
He will absolutely hate it.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
What else?
A flat-out hit.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Mystery. Deception.
Yes.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
What else?
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Life is real.
Where the hell are you?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
You know the answer to that.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Why does it matter?
What about my play?
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
I have excellent long-term memory.
I think I remember.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Would you like to meet him?
But you're his friend.
Where are you going now?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
He said he's in charge...
I've never spoken for anything else.
It was one incident.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Hm.  Is it?
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
Somehow I expected not.
Very well.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
All right. Fine.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
It's for the best.
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
Surely you know what you have.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You wish.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
What are you talking about?
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Not bad, Jerome.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
Last night?  I was at home.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You'll be next.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
I'll take care of my end.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I bought you a lot of new things.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
That doesn't hurt.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I mean it.
You sent me to him.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
And switched keys.
What do you want to do?
I think you liked it with him.
I did I killed a man.
Twenty eight hundred.
I think so... I don't know.
I don't want to hear it.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I guess we are.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
No, I'm not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Oh my God.
Suit yourself.
Two.
Whatever you need.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Sure am.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I know. I know.
And you told Brumby?
What?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Nicer than most.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Sid Fletcher.
Go on.
Of course. Where else?
You sure about that?
Sure I'm sure.
I don't know.
And you didn't know her last name?
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
No.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Where you off to?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
My brother, Frank.
No.
Pension him off.
Think about it.
Yes, thank you.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
And that'll make me feel better?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
We've got to take you back to London.
They do that up North.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
No.
Where am I going to work?
To get on the...
Well, I think I had one once.
I...I don't know.
It's too...
No.
Eh?
No.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
Himself?
You...
They...
When they...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
How?
We're not actually talking about it.
No.
Did you?
That's right.
You're saying "me."
You.
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Yes.
They're going to come to everyone.
...and rob the place...
...I thought that we were only talking...
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
You went for it.
If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Huh?
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
Thieves.
Why?
Yes.
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
That's great.
I didn't rob...
Just go to lunch.
Excuse me...
Moss...Who told him?
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Could I...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...then...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
It isn't me...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Murray said...
Either way.  You're out.
Not lately you can't...
I'm not sure I have two.
I can't do it, Shelly...
I have to go... 
The deal still stands, our other thing.
Did you tell 'em my sale?
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
I...
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
From the store.
Fuck her...
Kenilw...
My wife told me to look into...
Home cooking...
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
If we wait till Mon...
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
The power to negotiate.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
Not to my knowledge, no...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
You closed him yesterday.
Aren't you going out today?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Just a few days.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Michael...
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I understand...
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
What is it?  Can I help?
And you believed that story.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
Why?
How long does this go on?
Connie's outside.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
They can come in now.
Alright.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
I want it met.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, it was once.
Do you gamble?
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
This committee owes an apology!
Yes, Michael.
Where?
Michael.
Where can we talk?
You said you were Klingman.
Not for a few years.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
So?
Yes.
I do not.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
How much more a month?
Just thinking out loud.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
No!
Yes.  I trust you.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
Go ahead.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
I'm not, you know.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
No.  I --
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Nothing would please me more.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
It's too tight.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Fuck off!
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Ooooh.
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You didn't, Jimmy.
Yes.  Perfectly.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
I guess.
Right.
Don't go away.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
Who do you think?
How ya doing?
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You got no choice. It's over.
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
I don't golf...
A little family emergency --
Something like that -
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
We're partners here --
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
What color?
Dignity...
That's a good one, Donny...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
You getting my checks ... ?
Tuesdays ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Whatcha got left ... ?
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Just hold-on there --
I heard you were pumping gas -
Me...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
"Shadow games?"
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Price of doing business...
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Buy you a drink?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip's in trouble
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Hey -
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
No ... ?
Deodorant.
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
Of course you are. You're a professional...
How is he -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Yeah, I'm cool ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
You sure I can't go with ya?
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Why would I get into that?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
I'm in construction.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's been six months.
We did it.  We did it.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
I got dry cleaning.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?
Oh, Morgan!
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Why not?
I don't know.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Okay.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
Fuck her.
She's not stupid.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
History.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Fuck do you want?
Yes. Under two conditions.
Of course.
--That edge!
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Good to see you.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
My kind of background?
Five.
Tom.
Why would he do that?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Me too.
Who is he?
I don't got a crush on her.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
You're right. I know.
Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
You're getting defensive, Will.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
That must have taken you a long time.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
So Christ, call her up.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'll keep in touch.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I'm Will.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
Yeah.
How many?
Your house must have been a zoo.
Exactly.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
How do you know that?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why not?
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
I'll get Rosasharn.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Lots must a died, too.
Fan-belt's shot.
I didn't see nothin'.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Which way is House 25?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Hush!
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
I like the tent better.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Look, Ma!
Looks like you done it.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
California, here we come!
Casy, won't you say a few words?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Okay. See you later.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Overflowing with love.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
It's always the little things.
Yep.
Bad television.
Unbelievable.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Right.
What?
--She's not dead---
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
You're a government spook?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
What if I come back?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Yup.
I get it.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
See you next week.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I spoke to your father the other day.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
All by yourself?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Oh yes. I forgot.
It is. It's lovely.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Tom.
I won't ask you to.
I don't care! We'd be together.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Doesn't matter.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Fine!
I didn't know I had to.
I don't care.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
Don't they believe in signs here?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Thanks, honey.
What are you talking about?
Tom?
Well, now you know what it feels like.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
How's everything?
Exactly...
Okay.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
I know. We miss you too.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
You want to take a walk with me?
Oh, I don't know...
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
I'd love to go there one time...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Well, of course, right...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Diane!
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
I don't have all day.
I know where he goes.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
The number's by the phone.
Honey... I was always good.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
...as they snoop onto us.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Go fix the phones.
Curtis.
Up all night again, huh?
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
It's too much machine for you.
Your slave?
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
I know, I know who wrote it.
You what?
You would have looked better.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Phreak?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Nonono, thank YOU!
555-4202.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
All right.
I'm not angry it's just
No, you don't understand.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Michael Myers.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Brady!
Yes, sir.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Because the lights are all out.
I do.
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Oh Rachel!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
No.
Just do it.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Hi.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
No problem, Sheriff.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Why?
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Be here in a minute.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Bye.
He can still watch.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
I don't want to.
And I can't keep you interested?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Sure...
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
I killed him...
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
PROBABLY going.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Mm-mm!
A lot of works.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
I can't resist.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
I cry at the opera.
And it ruins everything else.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Mm-hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Let's take a look.
And it's just in one ear?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Oh, great.
Hi.
You're out looking here?
Ohhhh!
Yes, I do.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
I'm...all right.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Well, sure.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But not over me?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
It's so late.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
It's on the table, Dad.
Mom, come out!
Absolutely.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mmm...
Hmm?
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Because I have to!
Yeah.
Hello?
Like-- 
But there's nothing wrong with you.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Come on.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Is there no chance?
What are you talking about?
Okay, okay.
Oh, sure.
I should get a garter belt.
Singing?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Well, I just came from an audition...
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I was so bored!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Yes, you do recall, right?
Have you?
No, you can tell me.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Well, what about me?
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
...which I did not get.
...how are things at the Hospital?
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
You want me to be?
You're ready now.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...are you alright, sir...?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Have the child taken to bed.
You give me whatever I want...?
The children...?
And how would you know that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Why?
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Give it up.
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
...should love to correct your error. 
Well, perhaps sometime we...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Yes.... yes...
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
...and my need for The Institution...
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
...<u>what</u>...?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Or clear your windshield with it.
It would seem.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then what brings you back?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
What is your point?
...yes...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
...why?
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
When?
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Because?
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
You're all making me blush...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Goodnight.
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
You're beautiful.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
No. Hell no.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Color me nauseous.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
You're not funny. Ouch!
Oh shit, yeah.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
I didn't. Cherry.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Yeah, great.
Chick-en.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Like a suicide thing?
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Next channel, darling.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Did not.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
May<u>be</u>.
No-o!
The bomb, asshole!
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on through.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
What now?
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
John has fallen in love with me!
Mummy!
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
I understand... I won't-
Getting paid for doing shit.
Gwen.
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
What?
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Music to my ears.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
Allen?  He... he's okay?
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
You mean John Bubber?
Spanish kinda guys!
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
I...
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
The homeless!
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Yes.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
John, I know all about it.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Right.
-- hospital.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
I understand that.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Right.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Do you do washing machines, too?
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Honey --
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What?
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Fuck you, Philip.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
C'mon.
This is my house.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
What did the thermometer say?
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Not now.  I'm busy.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
Tough.
What?
Around.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
You?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
France.
No -- I will.
No -- after you.
Your life.
I'm leaving in the morning.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
If it's good advice.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Sounds very -- normal.
What?  How?
What's that next to him?
It has to be.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Get to work.
What do you want to do?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Not if they're looking at something else.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
We're trapped in a house.
Okey-doke.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Where is it?
I still see that boy's eyes.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
I know.
What I want is to help my father.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Where are they?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Go, Chief.
She didn't answer.
What's wrong with the radio?
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What?
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
We're okay.
Okay.
Who is it?
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
We are looking for you.
Of course.
And four children?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Canadian Club?
They're only taking the whites.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The front gate would be best, General.
I am on a list! What list?
Of course.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
This goes out live?
That will take time.
Call, sir?
One thousand francs.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Jean Baptiste!
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
What about us?
We have been abandoned.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
What for Paul.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
So where is the lamb?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
In Ruhengeri?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
A car.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
What sort of plan?
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
There is one thing I need right away.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Many times.
He has taken the presidential suite.
When?
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
I'm moved beyond words.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
C'mon.
-- I'm sure you did.
-- what was he doing here?
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Yeah, me too.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Take the gun.
Best of a nightmare.
Why not?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
So where's the party?
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
You're hurting me.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
I was in the middle of --
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
What?
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
He must've beaten us all here!
What's going on?
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Something....happened --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
It might have been her mother.
We don't have proof of that.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Ok...
I'm scared!
Where is she?
My God, I heard something!
To our family.
I don't know.  That's strange.
Ok.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
Come back to us honey!
Thank you.
The amulet...
What's going to happen?
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
And what did you discover?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
What is it?
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
And he still sits there?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Would you know this store again?
What on earth were you doing down here?
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Fuck you!
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Something like that.
Gum.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
Okay.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Anna, I think you better stay....
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
Ooh-kay...
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
God go with you, sister.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Said.
Prison?
How long were you in?
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Baseball, why?
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
He didn't look unhappy!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
I filed it yesterday.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
I'm sure you do.
Forty-eight years...
I --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
And Sid says you stole it!
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
There's one in every story.
Old Faithful.
She's damn good, Lou.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You don't believe in it?
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
Help me? How?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I told you.
I hated her.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Yes.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
Well?
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Hnnn.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Yeah.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
-- What advice? You never --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Nobody.
Educated guess.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Ouch.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
The Idiot.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Who said so?
Yeah?
Out.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Her name's Libbets.
What time is it?
Right.
What are you doing?
They left it in the jungle.
Vodka?
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Too bad...
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Yeah.  All over.
Twelve years younger.
I know.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
First I need a copy of the key.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
What happened at that signing?
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Will?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
I'm not expecting anyone.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
She wouldn't tell me!
What was?
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Oh?
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
No.
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
He jests.
Why not?
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
I can't. Go away from me.
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Yes...
You want death? Is it death you want?
NO!!!!!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Sure...
It can't be...
Read her thoughts.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
You finish her - if you feel so much -
NO!!!
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
You followed me here, didn't you?
Yes.
You can't look at them...
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
Can a vampire feel love?
No...
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
The guy looks dead.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Yes.
I've got to see.
No, you're not.
Can't what?
You know me to well.
I'm okay.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
He's in it with Willis?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
What is up with that weirdo?
Drunk again?
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Well ——
My friend -- what can one say --
You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
No one can take my father's place.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
Whet do you mean?
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ——
Yes?
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Thea?
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I'm not supposed to tell.
Sit down? What are . . .
George Bailey.
That's the kid.
No!
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Mother . . .
Today, over at the house.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Fine.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Goodbye, Sam.
A cattle boat?
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, she's not crazy about him.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
No, sir.
Aw, get going!
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Huh?
I know, but . . .
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Some other time, George.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Please, let's not stop, George.
My baby.
Oh, George, George!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Back down!
Swim for it!
We better go back in.
You bet.  Hang on....
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
You can't stop me.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Hey, come on....
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
The whale's mouth?
Is there one in these waters?
Sound?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
What'd I say?
What?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Sure they did....
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Waiting for Andy.
Great!
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
I can't stop thinking!
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
You got it.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Figure they split?
What the hell is it?
Coming about....
Not tonight.
I want to go with you!
Michael....
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
No.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
How come?
I don't like what he does.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
Just put your mask on.
Yes.
That we swim.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
After what happened to us?
Okay.
Sure.  Let's go.
... Mean through the tubes?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
I am.  You're not.
I told you, something's upset them.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Why?
Believe me, I am.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No, think of something else.
Goes up.
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
He's diving!
Hold still, damn it!
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
What the hell's there?
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
It's not closing, Mike.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
It sure is....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Where's my mother?
You caught me....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Spent it all on beer....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
It's too dangerous....
Who's coming?
Thanks for the consultation....
Mother....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
I'm not going to quit now....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
It could have been an accident....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
I'm terrific... Come on....
What?
Why?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Yes you can....
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Just like that?
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
Inch by inch....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Will you leave me alone...?
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
Hey!
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Holy shit!
When I invited you...
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Screw you, Jake....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
O.K.
There's nothing in the files?
I already did. What's his problem?
Maybe?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
So am I. But where's my money?
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Car accident.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
I'm asking it.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
Have you got a print from the hand?
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
My hands?
Me?
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
You should. It's wonderful.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Have you known her long?
You know? How do you know?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Yes, Sir.
What was she like?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
No, Sir.
I know about the bachelor party.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Well, take care.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
I just got goosebumps.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Sure.
Yeah, I did.
I may not sue.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Oh hell yes.
So I'll see you this weekend.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
I think we made a mistake here.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
He's in the living room asleep.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
I'll give it everything.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Fine.
Good deal, man.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
I'm a little worried --
I'm asking you a question --
Go.  Flee.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
They do, my brother.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
Quiet!
One way to find out.
What is it?
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What's a bad idea?
Oh, don't worry about that.
That one time was just the bumper.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
then we should...
Not if it can't dig.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
My favorite.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
We need to head for the coast.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
No.  I feel something.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
I don't believe you.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Come on!
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You've broken its leg!
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
You version of it.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
She's nuts.
Our chance to do what?
It'll hold!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Why did you come here?
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
No.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Six weeks?
Are you sure?
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
It's my favorite.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - a gizzard - -
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.

It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
He sends his apologies.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
You got me.
This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
You want to talk about this?
The kids okay?
Relatively.
What?  What can we do?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
Thanks, Steve.
Excellent.
Why did you do this?
They don't bother me.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Help me with this.
I really think we should go back...
I want to look at the rest of the house.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
He... he's here...
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
That's my job.
His camera... it's still recording.
Come on.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Fascinating.
Not yet.
About ten minutes.
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Tonight?
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
They're not obliged to tell.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
I'll bear that in mind.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I can't imagine you crying.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Jack!...  Jack!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
You're the animals - all of you!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
) They are now.
Yeah.
Did he come around often?
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Please --
Yes?
Do you always have to repeat?
Yes indeed.
So do I.
Well we're pretty --
What was better? I made better bait?
Will you let me go then?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
I can't say he was anybody!
Most of them.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
No thanks.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
No.
Is there anything more I could --
What're you gonna do next?
Well --
But if it's someone else I do.
How?
We did this before.
Yeah.
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Bree --
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Mm.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Show...
Sorry.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Yeah?
You mean for good?
See you in the morning light.
Dad?
I love you...
Sure.  Lots of times.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
No.
Was there Burger King?
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
No, I did not.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
And what is your present salary?
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Objection!
And how did you find his work?
Do you have a lover now?
How long was that?
What?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Joanna, I don't give a--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Joanna, what the hell is--
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
What?!?
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Joanna said that?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
What d'you tell her?
Sure.
What?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Again?
No cried?
I know.
Are you? Of whom?
Will you buy the sheep for me?
I will buy them for you.
Hmmm.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
All?
I am afraid.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
I miss my brother.
Please.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
Is that true or pretend?
As you say.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
The more he thrashes, the better.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
I never had sex with you!
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
No.
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
What?
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Good luck.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Okay.
He's floating.  Take it home.
He heeds a tourniquet.
I'll call the coroner.
Other than to eat us?
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
You talk to the married couple?
Not yet.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
I thought I saw...
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
I asked you to be nice to him.
Kevin, hey.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
<u>Kelly</u>--
Kevin told me you were upset.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
Kelly--
You're all right! Where is he?
I don't know! Get me out!!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
I think we may be, yes.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes sir.
Murdered...? How?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Are you finished?
Point taken.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You do until six p.m.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Reasonably so. Yes.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Early. Still dark.
What was it?
So you ran away...
But you could. You did.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Did you breast-feed her?
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Your "father"?
No. I will find you.
Maybe...
Yes. I want you to go.
...never doubt what you are doing.
What?
I sent three men to Webb!
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
I am sorry, Duncan...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
We were headed...
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Ottawa!
: Only one or two loads.
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Le mot d'ordre?
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What?...
Crunch...Implosion.
No.
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Good...It's going good.
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Like a leech.
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
Oh man, that's just great...
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Well what?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Yes?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Good job, Chris.
You had better be careful.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Furry muff, let's go.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
What they like then?
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
What the fuck is going on?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
I will loan you the money.
Well, perhaps you can help?
What are you doing, Plank?
My van is half full.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Nick the Greek.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
We need fertilizer, Winston.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
So?
Leave your sister out of it.
They're not going to jail.
I can fix cars.
Catholic school, nasty.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
A .45--
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
So?
Yeah, well--
Best part of the job.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Come on in--
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
I have a B average.
My father.
What's it doing on a rifle range?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously.
Pleased to meet you.
Substance abuse?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
What's in the back?
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Eladio Cruz.
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
He was a unique individual.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Charley Wade.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Sam--
Steve?
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
You told me one time it was true love.
Well, you hire illegals--
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
Nobody's too busy.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Okay? He's not here?
You got in late last night.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Yeah.
I mean what did we know about anything?
What was your father's name?
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
I appreciate you telling me.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
What's up?
Another woman?
They go together.
You ever been married?
A Nix specialty?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
It was me.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
I don't know where you'd start.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
What then?
Are you sure?
I'm here, Harry.
I think so.
No word from D'Amour?
Sure.
Oh God.
Heaven and Hell?
If he was so good why's he so dead?
Maybe I just bought it.
Probably.
A ticket home,
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
You want more money, is that it?
No.
Help me.
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
A Mister Quaid?
What's her problem?
Does anybody?
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Not much.
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
Harry D'Amour.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Looks that way.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
A couple of weeks.
Maybe... I... don't...
And he's dead?
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
You don't think I've got it to give?
I'm thinking about it.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
I know, it's stupid.
Hi, Charlie.
Ok.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Well... have a good flight.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Hi, Lydia.
What?
Oh, come on.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
It's ok.
Tomorrow.
One moment, please.
You wanna come?
I gotta go to work.
I don't know.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
When did they find her?
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
You killed my parents.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
How many weeks are you honey/
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
What's that got to do with you?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Yes, I know.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
What's the...OH SHIT!
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
Terrific.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Where is she now?
Oh, all that work.
Pants.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
To that stewardess?
That's ridiculous.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
Camille, she'll be fine.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
Sort of.
Get used to it, babe.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I know...
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up, Sidra.
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
I don't care.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Five seconds.
I know this.  What do you want?
I don't.
Your hot-ass temper.
He ain't Spalding.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Fine, Quincy.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
You want to go talk?
I'm not asking for us to be together.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Kiss my ass.
A rest?
Thanks.
So...how's the knee?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
You just got back from a four game road trip.
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
What?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
In my sleep, Burt.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
What's wrong?
No.  No.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Honey.
Who was it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
-- is not my boyfriend.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
You won't.  You won't have to.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
If you're not here for a 422 --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
No.
You wanna make a deal with me?
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Yeah, of course.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Just say no.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I'm almost done.
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
Might of been before my time.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Where is he?
When was the last time you talked to your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
No.
No.
Yep.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
Is that still lingering?
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Not really.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
And that's what you've heard?
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
people die.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
It's not your given name, right?
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Yeah.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
All your other fluzzies?
What happend to you?
I need you to get me Paula --
Love you too..
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
No one else that I know?
Two years...three years...
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
I really don't know.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
No.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Yeah.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
That is good.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
He is nothing now.
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
I am with you!
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Three days??!!
We must stop him!
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
But --
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
I know.  God go with you.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
Well... Well... Okay.
We go someplace dangerous.
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
To kill the king.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Porthos told me.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
A personal nature?
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
... You knew you had a double?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
A letter.  May I see?
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
It's lovely.  It's just...
Oh Louis, Louis...
Cooperate?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Don't worry -
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
It wasn't in the cards.
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
What?  Wait a minute -
Yeah?
You're the mysterious type, right?
You'll find out - soon enough.
What did you do then?
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
OK...where do you want to start?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
How are Molly and the boy?
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Somebody hurt him?
Last two like this we had, you caught.
What do you want to do?
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Something Lecktor said.
He had to.
Have him peel the top label back.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
What's being photographed?
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
Tonic will be fine.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
No. Reba...?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
You will tell the truth?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Goodbye.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I call him a monster.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue, then.
Do you remember what you said?
And... where are things?
I want to see you, too.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Thanks.
Yes. Who are you?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Yes.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Pictures?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Yes.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
Hi George!
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Really?
Deal.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Yes.
Know what?
I know.  It's her fault.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Goddamnit!
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
It's an honor.
The Matrix?
What truth?
That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
For what?
What -- what lesson?
Yeah.
How does she know?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
She helped you?
Why?
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Shit, I'm sorry.
Honestly?  I don't know.
What?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
Who is?
What is the Matrix?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
But an Oracle can.
She told me...
I don't know.  It just went dead.
I believe I can bring him back.
I'm coming with you.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
What do they want?
Neo, this has to be done!
What are you talking about?
Duck!
I'll be all right.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Hurry, Neo.
Nothing's private...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Panther!  Same thing...
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I could have told you that.
I understand.
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Forget it.
What can I say?
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Fine.
No you weren't.
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Well...
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Don't ask.
 Shut up.
I know...I know.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
You think so?
'Goddam party'!
Honey --!
And that?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
And a glass.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
How nice for you both.
For how long?  And why?
Don't you want to hear the details?
Are you running this Board or am I?
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Yes.
Don' need you okayin'.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
No.  Nothing.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Confused, huh?  About what?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
I am Joe.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Do you love Drew?
I don't have any.
Gay?
Yes.  I'm tired.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
And is your heart beating strangely?
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
It gets worse.
-- Yes?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
No.
Are you sad, Bill?
This part I'm interested in.
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
Just a manner of speaking.
I'm her father!
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
I told you, 'watch it'.
I was just asking, Bill.
So that's what love is?
Those were my words, Bill.
-- An IRS man.
I am not a dream.
And then --?
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
Get what?
What question?
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
Yeah.  Or the week after.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
How did you know?
Drew told me.
...Then don't.
I am.  With you.
You're not listening --
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
I'm sorry.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Condition?
Seen you together, that's all.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Who did this to you?
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
Take the money and walk away!
Why?
It's isolated.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Well, that's me.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Teddy!
Things change.
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
You like it? Let's trade.
Natalie who?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
You won't remember!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
Why would I do that?						    *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
We know these people...!
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
What do you think?
You can't.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
What do you mean?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
No.
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Switek?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
Sonny...?
White supremacist types.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Bored.
Not French registry?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
I know. Scribbage!
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Twenty bucks...
Keep the goddam blanket on.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
What you got me up here for?
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Ready for hard work, son?
You got it.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Listen!
For the money... )
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Thank you.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah.
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Cut his fucking throat.
Whose?
You know where it is?
Yeah? Where?
You can't take anything seriously.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Shit.
The Department of Public Health...
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Toss the flare down!
Peter-
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
What?
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
I'm not much of a critic.
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
It's fine.
Then the roads are open...
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Well, I hope you like it.
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
Yes.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
No big deal.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Nothing.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Well, it certainly says you.
To Misery.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
It will.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
Oh, I like that tone.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
So do I...
Newspapers?
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
You're still a writer.
Did they win?
That'd be a first.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Magic...
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Then don't say it.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Where?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
And you're happy about that?
What was the top bid?
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Far right.
- this is very disconerting..
Indeed.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Listen to what?
Ethan Hunt.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
I don't.
Then feel better!..
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
She sacrificed herself..
Yes, I gathered as much.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Roger that.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
She must still be on the property.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Okay!
All ten million.
I'm walking.
What kind of help?
Bastard!
Ethan?
Whoís dead?
Yes.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
The arms dealer.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
I didn't touch it.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Why not?
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Loud and clear.
What's going on?
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
The Shawfish?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Why you drinking so much?
I'm going to bed now.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
You haven't said anything.
You look tired.
Johnny Cammareri.
In a month.
What are you doing here?
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Hurry up.
Why?
How'd he die?
When you get engaged?
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I was dead, too.
What?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You ruined my life.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
It's the best thing there is.
I wanna go home.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
Is Johnny here?
Ronny, please...
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I don't understand.
This is a good suit.
Who is he?
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
What's the matter with him?
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
She was just too young for you.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I guess you can't invite me in?
People home.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You mean the whole house?
Oh.
Is who down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I knew she had it.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Am I right?
I'm not interested.
What?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
Of course.
Yes ...
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
So be it!
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
What?
Had enough?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Had enough ... ?
Come Here.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
What?
There.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
They cost fifty pounds each!
Leaving the room.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Ector.
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Not down south you don't.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
I'm flattered you think so.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Yes.  I do.
It can wait.  Anything else?
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Oh.
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
She trusts you, John.
She'll never understand it.
Archie.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes.
What?
What does he know about the Highlands?
Aye.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
Dear oh dear.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Yes, ma'am.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
A few days, ma'am.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Ma'am.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Yeah...
Hey, kid.
Funny.
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
And beat it at it's own game.
No I'm not...
Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
What?!  There's nothing here!
Thought so.
In this world, wrong is right!
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
You're broke!
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
I'll speak to someone.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
I understand.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Good luck, honey!
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Was anyone hurt?
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Oh...
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I'm not sure about this.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
What is it? What do you see?!
No... but...
Yes, Sir.
This Denny's.
You see what I mean...
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Oh yeah.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Sure.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Not listening !
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
We drown.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
He hired you to build this place ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Because of my charming personality ?
Are you hunting wabbits ?
What ?
Got it.
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
No.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
John, sir.
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
No I am not.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
What ?????
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
What do you remember about her.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Seriously.
Thanks, I needed that.
Give my love to Shelly.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Does she?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
I guess you have.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
MOM!
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Oh my gosh, here it is!
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
Uh oh...
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
You're a good man Nicholas.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Okay.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
You know how I feel about you.
Not exactly.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Oh no.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
This guy bonking you?
Yes.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Yes.
I'm looking forward to that.
Did you ahh, love him?
Perfect.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
He's okay isn't he?
No, no.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
I'm very nervous.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
No, no no....
Hi, is Vada home?
Sure.
Bye.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Come here, sit down over here.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
Thomas?
What are they about?
Okay.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
I will I promise.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
It's a mosquito bite.
If I do it, can we go?
No.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Come on, it's fun.
Don't DO that!!
What?
So?
I am running faster!!
Do it!
I do, she's real funny.
Uh huh.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
I have a suggestion...
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Neosporin?
I can't even say it.
What do you suggest?
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
To belong to someone.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Gold nose hair clippers.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Nobody has.  So far.
Well, somet...
I need you.
What's next?
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Me either.
The night we met.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
... yeah, that.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
This is where I proposed.
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
You're much more his type.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
I know that, Star.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
How did you come in here?
What's wrong with her.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Third party?
What does he want?
You know better than that.
Stop it!
How come?
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
National?
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Let me know when you do, all right?
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Yes, sir. I need a room
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
Suits me.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
Need a ride?
We don't mess with accessories.
Oh... Well.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
Yes.
That's not quite what I had in mind.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Oh.
Doesn't it have a name?
I have to go. He sighs.
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
I'm twenty-eight
I see.
Yes.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
You're real favorites of his.
Oh?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
What? Oh. A film.
No, we never did that
Southern California.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
It's not bad.
Sure thing.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Yes, I would.
Yes, you are.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Are we in a big hurry?
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Yes, sir.
Do you have a back up.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
I'm keen with anticipation.
All right, Mickey.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
That's indescribable.
Where's it parked?
On average forty million.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And they made the first move?
Just for fun, I guess.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
How 'bout Mallory?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Want to talk to you.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Anderson.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Any other family?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Oh yeah?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
Oh yeah? That's good.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
Maybe.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
How about another beer?
What is it?
I wouldn't have let you.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
That's right.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Don't look so scared.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
Watch out!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Well, that'll be the first time.
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
Like what?
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
'Don't sound so sure.
They'll run you out.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
I doubt it.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, I got married to one of them.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Right here.
Anything you say, baby.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Of course...
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
Very well.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I think you're full of shit.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
A regular Fagan.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
You're out of time, man.
Like what?
What?
What are you talking about?
YOU KNIT?
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
You stood for like a month.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
By Guy?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Eh.
He's my teacher!
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
I can't do this.
Thanks. And what are -
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
To put us back together again when we fall.
No, I'm alone.
What?
That's what I'm saying.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I know.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Why not?
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Don't be a smart ass.
No.  Upstairs.
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
Are you nuts or something?
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Yeah?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What's this?
What do you mean?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Hi.
Okay, I guess.
Sure...go ahead.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Hi Mom.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
That's right.  I don't.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I don't know.
I think so.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
But nightmares are the common thread?
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
What's that supposed to mean?
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
Just until we get things under control.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
I can do that.
Anything?
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Who would know where they were hidden?
No...
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
A sad choice.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
I won't allow it.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Fine.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Nothing.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
I have thought about you.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Yes.  Always have had.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Stay forever.
How do you think I'm doing?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
He wouldn't say.
The movie star?
Yup.
Don't even ask.
I never fancied you much actually...
And we intend to use them!
Where's Bella?
Di Caprio.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
The others?
This is Henry James film?
Well, fire away.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
I suppose so.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
Definitely no comment.
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
So not over her, in fact.
Does she know you're coming?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Yes.
So?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Would you like to start?
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
No! No! No!
Mister McMurphy!
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
On this ward?
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Yeah, kid?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Marry who?
M-M-M-Mack?
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
God Bless America.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Yeah, Mack?
Shhh...
Me too...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
You heard me the first time!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I just started!
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
No! I wanna go!
I'm hungry.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
We'll let you know.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
I don't believe it...
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Just great!  See ya around!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Are you a doctor?
Take you han's offa me!
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
I thought so.
He's dead.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
No, she wasn't my sister.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Ha un numero di telefono?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
But, Faith--
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Who's this?
My name's 
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
You are leaving, aren't you?
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
Right now?
NO.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
GET OUT!!
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Really?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Oh.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
You don't have any idea?
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Sorry.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Is he looking at us?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
What?
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  He is.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Oh.
That's exactly what you are.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She's not here.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Good strategy.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
Then don't.
That was the idea.
In a minute.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
What makes him so special?
I better see you get there.
I better get home.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
The moment I saw you.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
I don't know.
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
It's quite—  –nice.
What a fruitcake you are!
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
For— not being any help?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Go ahead, wear it.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Who says?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
Edie, Edie, I...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, for God's sake.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
I don't want to hear it in there.
What do you want from me, Father.
Are you on the level, Father?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
I don't know nothing.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Looking for me?
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Go on— a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
I got it. Hot off the press.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint—  –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Okay.
In there.
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Whatever you do, don't do that.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
...And I thought you loved me.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
A situation easily remedied.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
No, thanks.
Really.  Hm.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Just hung up.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
You know how I felt about her.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You'll have to ask him.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
What do you want to bet?
You don't, huh?
That's right.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
So you've done this before, huh?
Nervous?
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Uh-huh.
You have to be kidding.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Why not?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Is that how you think of yourself?
I don't have a problem with it.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
I called your room from downstairs.
You waved to me in the elevator.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
The backseat.
I don't know...
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
The fish?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
For a time.
There were others.
Hejira.
Glenn, take the exit.
And is Foley a part of this?
Uh-huh.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Oh...
I can tell.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Can we change the subject?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
I'd like that.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I see that.
Not at all.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
I told you, he isn't here.
When's he due back?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
There's another one!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
From the air?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Thank you, Sir.
Explain what?
Well sure, Colonel --
Win?
What do you get for winning?
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Crank her!
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Why wait?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I've got to go now.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
What would that be, sir?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
You don't?
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
What're you doing here anyway?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
For everyone.
I hate chickens.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
The hat business is in trouble.
Yes.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Please don't shout.
What about?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
What do you know about hypnosis?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
So are you. You've got a vision.
I... um...
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
All set.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You know everything, don't you?
What's wrong with your face?
Andy?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
Fuck you.
Close the law book.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
No sweat, buddy.
Don't do this, Andy.
About my blood work?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
As in, the vegetable?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Rayisha.
They didn't fire her?
No. They didn't fire her.
It's me, you dork.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
Thank you.
Yes.
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
That's correct.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
You're the asshole, buddy.
Get a life.
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
He was doing a great job.
Charles...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
You sure you can keep --
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
Can we switch?
What, switch what?
Hey, me. Over here.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Like my pistola.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Well, don't ask me to.
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
For now.
There is no "safe."
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Looks clear.
About the girl.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Zira....
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Any particular reason?
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Hmph.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Do as I say.
What signal?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
long pause) You know it.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
I'm prepared to die.
Climb off me, will you!
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Okay.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Maybe not.
Taylor, please --
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Why not?
God bless you.
This is his assertion.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! 
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
What are the heads?
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Who gives a shit!
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Well..
I don't know.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I haven't been invited.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Just drunk enough.
I didn't say anything.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Sure... but somebody always does..
There wasn't any plane.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Just who are you, anyway?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Why not?
They know you here--know your name.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Absolutely sure.
You don't know who he is?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
That, and the fun of it.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
You-killed-him?
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Magruder does.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You understand perfectly.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
You, Killaine?
You're not English.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Quite sure you had no motive?
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
The only answer I have for you.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
He saw my face too.
Convenient, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Floater?
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Go live in a tent.
Where's the shell?
So?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Not if it clears the air.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
How about Magruder?
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
She might.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Yes, sir.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
So-so.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
That's not very kind.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
He was delightful.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Thanks.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
Yes.
What went wrong?
Hello.
Are you going to have coffee?
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Mmm...
You're so gross.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
U-huh.
She said that?
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Oh no!
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
De nada.
You gotta earn trust.
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You first!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
No.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
I take the skin off chicken.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
The shit they pull, huh?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Got it.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Nothing.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Catch of the day.
What are you talking about?
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
We're not going.
You know you can't win this one.
What, Sergeant?
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
It's been a long time, General.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
I can't tell.
Twenty-five percent.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
What?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Fair enough.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Oooh, thank god.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
... dollars?
What are assets?
I'm in town until Saturday.
Five full nights... days too?
I have work to do.
Was someone rude to you?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
He died a long time ago.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
Where are you taking me!?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
Right.
It was a business decision.
It felt good.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
No.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Have you lost your mind?
Kit!  Where've you been?
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Dummy.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
You're a guest here?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
They will serve salad.
Yes...
Excuse me?
I think it's great.
Then I'm here till I die?
So it's to be torture.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
There will never be a need.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
-- what? --
The body?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
My spy network has heard no such news.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
DEATH FIRST!!
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
Not yet.
Light him.
In that case --
-- anything you want --
The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Are you a rotten liar.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
Nothing comes to mind.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Begin!
Okay.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
"I want to croon,
"Honeymoon,
Oooooooops!
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Do the books!  Do the books!
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Double.  Double.  Double.
Liebkind, no!
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Vat about it?
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.
Very nice girl.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Send for Goebbels.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Look at the picture. Please.
No one met her?
Back where?
How did she pay you?
Cash.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Money.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
All right.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Sure...
Is Mary here?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Here?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What's the matter?
What do you know about it?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Sam.
In a hurry.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Neither will I.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
This is the old highway.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Bates.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
I have to go, Sam.
No.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Sam! No!
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
Sam, let's go get married.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
You'd know, of course.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
What are you running away from?
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
To a private island, like you?
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright, Miss... 
Why?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Mother, please...
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Indeed, he has often told me.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Who are you? What is your name?
I don't know, [I tell you].
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
That spoke to you?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
It happens that I'm the law.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
We'll grant that.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
That's what I said.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
That is unfortunate.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
He can't hear you.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Excuse me???
Day or night?
A place you've never been.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
What universe are you in, Paul?
A quantum one.
Nobody.
They were just bad men, that's all.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Buddy, you're just a child.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
How did the rabbits kill him?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
I do, too.
All right, what do you know?
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
But how would you find him?
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
I think Daddy suspects.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
How could that be, son?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Go on, Doctor.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
All right, darlin'.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Over... my... dead... body!
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, it's Billy.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Galley proof.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
She looks terrible, just awful.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, Ma'am.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
But... I love him.  I do...
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
I need the "when" and the "where."
She's fine, as if you cared.
Lay off once, would you?
What'd I say?
We'll share.
Get ready.
Relax.
Stop blaming yourself.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
We have to find Kittle.
No, we're stealing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
You're lying...

What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Don't crowd him.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Out here.  On your knees.
Gimmie a minute.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
It's one of a kind.
But I had to help my friends.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Who are you?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
We got separated.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Lower it!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Let's see.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Tell me.
Your father?
I know, father.
I will not fight you, father.
I will not fight you.
Certainly not!
Uh huh.
Oh Brad.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
We must have a blow-out.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Yes.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
"Transylvania"
Oh my, my,
Like I'm outside in the rain
Oh.
Creature of the night.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Ohh!
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
It's okay.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
What?
'Bout seven.
It did.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
...I can't beat him.
Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Paul.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
It's not your house --
Owe you what?
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...This man.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Kiss my ass.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
This a con?
How 'bout some Cokes?
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
That's it? -- Completely?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Mr. Balboa --
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
...What?
...Who'd ya fight?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Yeah, sure.
'Bout an hour ago.
How do you mean?
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Please, kid.
Real good.
Would you keep goin'?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Let's get outta this stink.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...Tight.
What?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Toon cops worked me over.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
He made me laugh.
That's what you woke me up for?
What a gasser.
I don't work in Toontown.
So's the job.
Maybe.  Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Divorce?  Never!
Don't ever forget that.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Two bits.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I think you oughta read it to her.
From this box here...
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
No better?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Romeo, come forth.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
I take thee at thy word.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
I thought all for the best.
I am for you.
Is she a Capulet?
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
You know it is.
So where do you go from here?
How do we know that?
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Nothing.
You lose them!
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Bloody fucking hell...
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
What do you mean?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
You'll die if you leave here.
What's a little hate between business partners?
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Created?
Why don't you go do better, then...
I don't think so.
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
See what?
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
Clearly.
Do what?
It's my job.
How could you have done that?
You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
I know.
You sure?
I'm alright.  And you?
Why don't we step into my office...
I might know where you could get a copy.
I get the picture.
I want to get some hounds down here.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Oh, you would have done great.
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Because...I know.
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
All right we will.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
I don't know...
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
I don't know...
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Two thousand...
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
No.  It's not.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
I know.
Are you sure you're OK?
How the hell did he find it?
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
I have a better plan.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Is this marked money, or what?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Uh...C?
Take it or leave it.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well I'm here now.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Then what the hell are you all about?
What?
Oh Jesus Christ...
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
At least around here it does.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
So...what's the good news?
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
No, sir.
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
How much is that?
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
I got my sources.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
I don't need a turn!
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
It doesn't matter.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
Yes.  We have heaven.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
What is Mac out?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Why don't you go get them?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
You must come with me for questioning.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Yes, I know this song.
Good God, ya'll!
I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
How much they want?
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
Han?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
After I left?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
"Nothing but net."
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Or a vegetarian?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
You have one?
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Six-fifty.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Bob will be very happy.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
I love you, too.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
I don't think so.
What?
About forever.
I do.
-- it was a betrayal.
I think that's what I'm saying.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
Can too.
No.
I know.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Is this crazy?
Thank you.  I love you.
Good night.
But he saw you, right?
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
What are your plans in New York?
I love the symphony.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Go home for the weekend.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Magic.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
What's tira misu?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Window.
It's never happening again. Right?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
What?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Good.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
She's going to cook something for us?
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Victoria? She's okay.
Who is Annie?
The one who wrote us.
This conversation is finished.
Did too.
I'm sorry --
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You're kidding --
What do you mean?
Hi.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
You haven't tried locking them up!
You want 'em all arrested?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
I've had them since the day they were born.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Ramón -- you can't.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
But honey ...
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Are you Australian?
Did you see his hair color?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
That bad, huh?
This man sounds like a real catch.
Colette ...
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
I can't.
You don't understand.
What is wrong with you?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
He knows where I work.
Ass first into the world.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Palmdale
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
Was he the president?
Thanks for not laughing at me.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
Good for you Jimmy.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Secret recipe.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Okay! Okay!
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
To who?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
You mean like the Donner Party?
What do you mean?
Better than drugs.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
Where are your men now?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
You take account of the wind?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
White-walls?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
It was nothing.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Pass.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
You?  Leading a squad?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Hell of a mission.
And what about you?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
How about I go right, sir?
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Out of the mouth of babes.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Huh?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
You have orders, too.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
We can't leave it here.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Gee, it's easy.
Yeah.
I still am.
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
See you tomorrow.
I admit nothing.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I already did.
Read it.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Come on, it's graduation.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
I dream about it.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I love you too honey.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Dad, I'm sorry.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Honey, about what?
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Saturday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Then call me tomorrow.
Yeah?
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
We'll see.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
One more time would be nice.
Okay.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Yeah.  Honey?
No, really.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Just her name.
Lloyd.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
They're not gone, they're here.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
Look -
Pistols?
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
You'll lose money.
No.
I heard a noise.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
That's too bad.
Why would you wanna do that?
Can we talk?
You could start with an apology.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
What's your subject?
I think it's out of your control.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
No, it's not.
That’s quick.
I got it..
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
We'd break some furniture.
He filmed his victims.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Just in case...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
But who would operate your camera?
Are you in danger now?
I don’t know.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Her old boyfriend?
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..harmonica style is okay.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
I get scared really easy, okay.
He's after me.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
To see your reaction.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
What did you know about your mother?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
What about me?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Bitch.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Who?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Who's this.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Who's this?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Yes.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Sorry.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
You sleep in THAT?
What are you doing here?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Oh it did?
I'm going... I'm going.
It's okay. We need to talk.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Are you serious?
Who are you trying to reach?
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
I don't think so.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
What do you think I said?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't...
What do you want?
Guess.
Afraid not.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Answer the question and I will.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
I don't think you're so bad.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Hold up a sec...
Shit.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
I told you to send it back.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
I want to talk to you.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And why would she do that?
Ricki Lake.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Uh-huh.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
What?
I can cry on cue.
He came to make up.
Yeah.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
I don't know, they just did.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
You know.
What?  What?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Not here.
Drop it.
No one yet.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
How's that?
Hello.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
It's got to be.
No.
Oh, that's all.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No.
Yes we do.  Here...
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Give me a break.
What did you say?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
It surprises me.  It really does.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I want to have children.  It's just...
Crime of passion.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Why don't you finish the job?
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
I ain't wearing no gun.
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Yes, sir.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
If they're still alive...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night...
Why?
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
That don't make 'em kin...
Oh...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Over there!
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
It wasn't much of a letter...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
But couldn't you...?
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
I'll do it myself.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
In the village.  Look what I found.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Thank you.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
Very funny.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Put his feet in.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Nobody knew!
What happened to Sam?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Who wrote that?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Ethel.
A different one you haven't written?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Virginia?!
It is not my riding day, my lord.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
And her voice? Like lark song?
In the same fashion as chess.
Will you shut up and play.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Come on, David.
Juliet?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Take his legs.
I want to talk now.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
That's all?
I see.
Yes.
Cameron?
Really?
Just serve.
Well, she had problems --
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
So I gathered.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Yes.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
David?
No, no, it's different.
It tastes different.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Would you like to talk about it?
Yes. They're my friends.
No.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Exactly what I was --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Writing seems easy.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
The human condition.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
Don't you like her?
Then what's the problem?
That you were just indulging me.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
I don't know.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
But you don't know what happened.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Right now, I just don't care.
That headboard.
No thanks.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Why?
Don't make conversation with me.
Great.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Did you?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Well, did you or didn't you?
You're a genius.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
Look who's talking.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know... Jackie?
What?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I'm busy, man.
What with?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- Otis?
-- took a bus.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Great... can we talk later?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Egypt.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Let go of me.
What do you wanna know for?
What difference does it make?
How?
Does it make you happy?
That's all you've got to say?
-- yes.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
No?
But Mr. Norman said --
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Well, yeah.
Yes it is.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
They're not?
Did they have something against me?
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
Why, why do you think that is?
Have a drink.
I'm finished with her.

Yeah.
I'm coming over.
A soap?
Is that right?
I am?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
Of course not.
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I know, I'm sorry.
I guess not.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
C'mon.
-- uhh-huhh...
Well he's not exactly a friend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
No.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
You mean they ate each other up?
What?
Yes.
Room 237?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
No.
Why not?
Thank you.
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
I'm a Wendy.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Which room was it?
Yes.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
All the best people.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Eight thirty.
Uncle Al-
Blue. This blue.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you marry me, Jane?
You're a real booger, you know it?
Rats...
I don't get you.
Yeah! What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
I will- be good, kids.
Oh?
You know what we're saying!
Were you tempted?
And I'm tearful!
Oh my! 
Right.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
You betcha.
I know.  It's ancient.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
It's true -- I know her.
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Wet behind the ears.
Sing!
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Experience!  Right?
Honey.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
The reason?
Your cigarette -- out.
And all those like you.
No food?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
A vote?
You saved my life.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
Screw you!
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Me too.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Oh-huh.
So, take it off.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Yes?
However, we can also pray for other things.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
Two days... ?  For murder?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
You need to sleep.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
They need guidance.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Up.
What kind of nuts?
No, I couldn't...
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
I doubt that's the end.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
I insist that you have it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
What has happened?
What?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
It was you there?
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
He moves too fast.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
She has confessed.
That boy wants me to.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
How are you, Bill?
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
What you got that's good to eat?
French-fried potaters.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
It's too big.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
Would y'all like that?
No sir.
I hate you!
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
What's all them books?
What numbers do you punch?
I aim to kill you with it.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
They still around, your folks?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Were they bad people?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Yeah.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
He ain't ever okay to me.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
My history.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
So, you're really going to stay here?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Okay.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Why won't he talk to women?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Actually, I'm his father.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Forty-one pages.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
It's yours?
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Not a peep.
You usually get two.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
You got it.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
You what?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Five thousand bucks.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
So I can get my job back.
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
I figured he had a right to know.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Yeah? And why is that?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I mean breakfast.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
How long have you been here?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
You don't really want to know.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Let's not get too idealistic.
You work too hard, you know that?
Come on, just a little hint.
The inspiration.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
That money is my whole future.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Easy.  Slow is best.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Objection!
Tht was summation, Your H...
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Yes.
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
And what do you believe?
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
And her farmhouse...?
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
Obviously.
I already said that, b...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Bye.
Why?
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.

It's private.  Go away.
What did he say?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
With me?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
You don't see any blood?
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
Then pull the emergency brake!
You can both go take a flying jump.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Joe -
What?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
What's that?
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
You like it?
I always did.
Yes.  For a whole year.
You invest in shows?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
I don't care.
Why?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Then why did you take this job?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Men!
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You are?
What makes you so sure?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Now, really -
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Harmless - how?
Have you tried?
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good morning.
Let's make it an even million.
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I knew you would.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
I cut myself shaving.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, Amy.
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I don’t think I should be allowed to get married.
Actually, I do.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Yeah, kind of.
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Maybe not her least... There’s always--
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
I slept with your sister.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
I’m compulsive and weird?
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You stand on your tiptoes.
Oh, no.
I guess so.
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Oh, cut the crap!
So, why’d you say yes to me?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
You want me to let him in?
Meet Nick.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
She was dirty and wet...
It's cold, Daddy!
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Where was you, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Yes mam...
David, come back here!
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
You sure can, son...
No mam -- I looked all over.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'm used to it.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Whatcha got there?
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
No you can't Kenny!
AGAGAH!!
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Mph rm.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
Totally!
Wow!
I'll just try the first one.
Yeah, so what do we say?
What is 'fisting'?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
-Or monkey fucker-
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Right away, ma'am!
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hey, relax guy!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Anna...
Excuse me?
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Why, didn't they say?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Simulated space walking.
Ready as I'll ever be.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Sure.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
What kind of man?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
- canker sore.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
I ain't nobody's father!
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
No...
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Clam it!
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Uh...over easy.
Junior.
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
You made me hurt him!
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Leave him alone!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Line up where you want it.
Whips...orange whips.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Do you have a girlfriend?
No. Do You?
Do I want you?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Sheila, please.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
He's my father.
Did you - kill him?
You should.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
Get out of there!
I said back away.
Nobody move!
What if it attacks?
What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Pull it, damn it!
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Anything else?
Nothing else.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
-- Wait a second --
Take a look.
Just worry about yourself.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Damn it, Edmunds?
Pull it.
In the ship, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
He understands me fine.
What do you make of this?
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
What?
Resetting the sub.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
Underwater?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
What -- are you threatening me?
Yeah.  Drowning.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
We have a library?
Wait a minute.
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Don't bother me, Norman.
Why should I go?
Fixing it.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Manifested?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How long does it last?
Not believing you.
I'm feeling better.
You know what I mean.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
You think I manifested the snakes?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Shut up, Beth --
It's either this... or I kill you.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
You'd have to ask them.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
You're staring at me.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You don't understand about the sphere.
That far in what, Harry?
Did I?
Her suit's gone.
Wisconsin?
That's right.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
That's right.
The ships?
The others, sir?
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Captain who?
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Is that good or bad?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
I'm not going out there.
May the Force be with you.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
You saw through me?
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
They'll find its weakness.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Something... I've got...you don't.
What do I want with a scar ?
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Zander, please... Let's go !
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
A funeral.
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Yeah, sure, I guess.
He's nothing like you.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I love you.
Should I be ?
See you on the bounce !
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Too bad for her if she's not around.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Flip six, three hole.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Well, excuse me, sir...
All bands.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Here in Buenos Aires.
Courage, I guess.
You can never be sure.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Cover us, Ace !
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
To join, and become One with the Creator?
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Mr Decker....
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
No.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
We're ready, sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
I quit the movie.
It's...
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Better idea...
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
You going to ask me in?
I used to go out with a politician.
Sure did.
No, that's true.
What?
...and we could get up every morning...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Go you Huskies...
That's right...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
I <u>know</u> my lines...
I loved it...he...
It's...
I'm having dinner with W...
I swear that that woman in my room...
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
We've got three days to...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
There's other things to be learned.
What's his name?
I think he's moved...
Well, what's the beef?
Then what is the...?
I wasn't in the car.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
That's my...
Will you help me out...?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
What?
An artist of your caliber...
...yes...
Bob are you alright...?
I'll put the, in your r...
I can't tell.
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Later for you, pal.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Grace...
I grew up on your mov...
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
What did you say to them...?
How do you know you saw it?
I...
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Pay her off.
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
Sherry, this...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...it is?
It takes all kinds.
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
You think so?
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Mass hysteria.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Good girl.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Thank God for that!
And this is my room so get out!
That's so weak.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Is your bad?
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Remarried.  There is no move.
You think I didn't get that?
Rachel's not half my age.
Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
Easy enough.
You're WHERE?
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
We...
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
Wowie.  How wonderful!
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
How's she doing with Brad?
Thanks, but it's under control.
It's the same choice you made.
Is that what he told you?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
Are we.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Double.
What do I have that you don't?
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
Does Jackie know this?
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
What?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Really? How many?
I'm still poor.
This is work.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
My baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
No, you don't.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
I can read it to you.
Just the same.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Gee, you're home early!
Uh huh.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
...gger.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh, I don't remember that...
You should be.
Yeah. I know.
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
But what did you get on your SATs?
He did?
Why? Are we going dancing?
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Shut up!
She's as good as gone...
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Richter-we got a problem!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Dissent?
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
I have your word, Mister President?
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
That's government property, Major.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
What kind of trouble?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Plan-R????
Yes, sir.
That is correct, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
I guess so.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Do you think we'd cheat?
Do you think they would cheat?
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Then there's no chance for recall?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Master Kong.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Master safety on.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
He's dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
You tell me.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Yes.
Typical male.
No I quit.
Yup.
Sounds like a bummer.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
It's your birthday?
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I mean, no one.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
You know?
Wait. Hey, man.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Hey.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I will.
Please!
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Oh, So what about her?
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Okay.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
I'd like to.
Mm-mm.
Deep down. Way down.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Taking care of business.
Oh, wow.
Hi, I'm Erica.
It does look good.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
What?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Wow. You did that for me?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Seven-twenty.
I gave it to you.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
How?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Sooze.
Come with me.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
No, I don't.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Go.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
What?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Get off my property!
No, this has everything to do with you.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
What's that supposed to mean?
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Yeah.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Jeff!
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Kim-Lo?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Into what? A lampshade?
Well, for heaven's sake!
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Nobody can be that busy.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
Come on in, Betty,
Come on, Joe.
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I will not have it butchered.
It's getting kind of late --
Where do you live?
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
You think this is all very funny.
Keep it.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Good.
Why do you say that?
Yes, I am, Norma.
Wanted what?
That isn't true! Max?
For me?  Okay.
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
What doctor?
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Paramount is calling.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
What is it?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Maybe it was just an accident.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
What do you feel about me?
But why?
I'm not mad at you.
Miss what?
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
I'll mention it upstairs.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I know it.
Nurse! Help !
I don't want your help.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I allowed it to escape the City.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
She's a beast.
But what for?
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
He's nice.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Cigarette?
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
A cheap trick.
Then come with me.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Who?
Oh...I came close once.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Oh?
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
The boss wants to see you.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
What are you talking about, fella?
KRYPTONITE!
For what?
What will it get me?
Stone mutha.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
We back in Metropolis?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Thank ...you.
You just did, with that great dinner.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Why do I have to do this?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
I do?
Be my guest.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I'm listening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
You're not selfish at all.
Lois, I really don't see why --
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Why didn't you go before we left?
What's a curl?
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
 DELETE IN CUTTING
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Yes, but will you honor it?
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
I'm sorry.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Daddy . . . ?
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
. . . And  very naïve!
An angle?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
The one Superman wrecked up?
This wasn't in the plan.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Bunkers!
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Of this...Superman.
What are you doing here?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Nothing.
Folks'll ask question.
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
How good it felt -
You've got me? Who's got you???
Right on the first guess.
I guess they are a little odd.
It is for me.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Of time, Luthor.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
That's okay.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Say hi to Zoe.
Case?
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Billy, please.  The children.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Billy, that's too early.
Well I don't.
About the Ottos?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berries.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
With our hands.
What do you mean?
That's right.
Did they give him special care?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
What's that, Dolores?
Billy said that?
Excuse me?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Did he say what about?
Oh.
You hate that.
I won't lie.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Thank you, Nicole.
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
What do they do?
Here we go.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
So what's the problem?
I tested positive.
Yes.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Poached salmon.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
No.
Yes.
You are?
Before the actual accident?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Pretty slick, eh?
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
You don't know that.
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Can I come in for a minute?
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
He means that much to you...?
I read your column every day...
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
What does that mean - integrity?
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
You're sure.  Find out for me.
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Can you be there by two-thirty?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
What would you think of me if -
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
That's no way to talk...
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
No problemo.
You will.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
I have to go away, John.
I order you not to!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
It, John.  Not him.  It.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Open the goddamn door!
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
And Skynet fights back.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
Eating is eating... and...
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
But I promised your mother.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Then you're going to kill me.
You do shorthand and typing?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Tough, tough!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yes, von der Null.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Yes, that's what happened.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Do it, Helmuth.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
One of my people?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Absolutely not.
I won't let the fat kid down.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Just what you see, pal.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
That's none of your business.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Kyle.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
What's that?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
No.  I'm not.
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Who is in authority here?
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
I just called.
Like shit, boss.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I'll be right with you.
I said I was sorry...
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Alright... okay...
What are you talking about?
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Not here!  They can see.
Get out of my car!
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
What are you talking about... ?
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do we do?
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Big family... small?
Studied acting, I assume?
Single?
Boyfriend?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Trust me.  Call that number.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Yeah, almost...
How do you mean, exactly?
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Did she?
Have you gone to the police?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
What's all this for?
Oh... it's a game.
It's different every time.
It's all down to this...
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Don't take another step.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
What?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
You know you can.
Attempted murder.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Greetings.
Sure.
There's a carriage house around back.
Just stay there, Nell!
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
I got more scared.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
No --
What?
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
But the experiment was a failure.
I know.
No.  The world has missed you.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
Well?
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is that a problem?
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
Like you.
Sure.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
We think?
Not bad.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
What did you tell them.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Let him break - he likes to break.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
No reason.
It was better than a telegram.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
You goin' back inside?
One thing I need.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
No, but I know what he means.
No, why did you come here?
That's not what I heard.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Modelling.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Where you get your bank statements.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Right.
Why not.
What do you think.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
I can see the attraction.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Up the coast.
How far?
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Of the deal, man.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
No kidding.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
What?
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Walked.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
What do you think?
What are you doing here?
Be seein' you.
Tell you ...
Ann--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Hello, Tony.
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Birdy--
It's OK...
No. Uh... family friend.
Did she make mistakes?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Well, you know what that would do to me.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Mm.
Congratulations, Gina.
You don't have to tell me anything.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
...OK.
So... who... who actually--
No thanks, honey.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Yeah.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Huh?
Yeah.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
What the--
Yeah.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
He said OK. Is that what he said?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Let's go!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right everybody, hold up!
I hope you liked it.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
You're right.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Like this.
They were yellow!
Quiet.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
How does it work?
Where did you see it?
All right.  If you're positive.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
The planetarium!
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
Why wouldn't I?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's to see?
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
That and a fat, new contract.
Certainly a nomination.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
Really?
The thing that started all of this.
It's a surprise.
Did something happen today?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
I bet you did.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
Things always do--when you look back.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
Who?
There's no one here.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Sorry. Don't have one.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Me?
Working with?
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Yes.
Brought on by what?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Is it an emergency?
I'm looking for him.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Who sent you?
Before the bomb went off?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
Did you find something?
What's wrong, Scully?
You're looking for a bomb.
How's that?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
No you didn't.
Scully, I found the bomb.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Why?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
And you've never seen anything like that?
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
This is great. This is fitting.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
This virus -- it... 
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
About what?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
How deep does this go?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What about you?
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
What happened?
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
What then?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
That's what therapists are for, right?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
If you believe that.
Yes.  I am.
I got it.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
I need you to find something in the basement...
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
Awaiting his arrival.
I don't have to.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I was told there were only two men there.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Where is she?
I don't know.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
I shall be all right.
His.
Of course.
Thank you.
They are - private - letters.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
No.
Schmolka!
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Bring him in.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
No, I don't know...
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
I want to talk to you.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Coffee.
Zwei zwartze.
The Roumanian?
Thank you.
Hear the details.
You saw it?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
He didn't want to get involved.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not when I get interested.
Oh.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Just take it, OK.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Thanks.
Traveler.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
So how many miles do you think it is?
A fin!
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
A bit fucking late.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
Two.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
He's an asshole.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
I have a job.
Too difficult?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Is he a Nazi?
What do you care?
Even though his dick is so big?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Why should I submit?
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
And be crushed.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
What about Curtis Zampf?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Who? How would I know him?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
I don't think you know what you are.
Get the fuck away from me.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Don't tell me what I --
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
What...?
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Where?
I have an idea....
Shut up...
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
I can tell....
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
And let us say...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Johana, am I boring you?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
He seems to have won it.
Congratulations.
No.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Italy!
He can learn.  He is learning.
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
Forget it.  I was joking.
... For the mermaids.
Well... about everything.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
... I'm listening.
You don't have that one, do you?
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Thank you...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Give it to me.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Johana... New York.
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
They got the new T.V.
You called the police?
What?
No.  I'm just depressed.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
... Yes?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
I said, do you come here often!?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
He's still working out some identity issues.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
The elderly man I told you about.
Let me see it ——
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I want to ask you something.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Tell me.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I thought they came right past here ——
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
I know. Funerals.
You. Us.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
I know -- Teresa -—
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where you’re going.
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Disney! How inter...
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Simplify and damn.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What do you suggest?
Croissants.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I know where to look.
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Like you’ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
The company. We all work for the company.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
You seem very sure about that.
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Où est passé ton salon?
Then why don’t you reach him?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
They've started the battle without me!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
You make it sound so simple...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
I tried to.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And when was that?
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Who are you?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Silence her!  Take her away...!
I understand.  How much?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
I'm... I'm not the king...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
If there was, I didn't see it...
20,000 gold crowns.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Perfectly.
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Here -- take this instead.
It's not possible...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
My king.
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I... I never lied!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
So your memory's coming back?
Really?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Really?
What are you doing on the wall?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Is that bad?
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Yes.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
He's still a doctor.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Thanks.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Do they?
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
But I want to help, I want to.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You made contact?
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No.
She never gives him a turn.
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
No, no cops!
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
We'll be waitin'.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
You sober?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I picked something up on the way.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
If we ever get to it.
No, not a thing.
He'll show.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
I also gotta win.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Sixty-five.
Then why the rat?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
Get on with it then.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Why don't ya then.
Let me talk to him.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
He's right, Les.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
We missed him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He was?
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
I'm sorry.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
What are you talking about?
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Yes, she would.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Where are you going?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes.
I'm very interested in that body.
What's that to you?
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
Man to man, I'm not.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
I didn't know they had a fight.
I see.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
What bonds?
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
No.
Slim.
Well, don't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
All right - you didn't.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Yeah.
Is that another Christmas present?
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Got a nice evening dress?
I wish you'd tell me.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
I hope you're well.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Yes.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Oh, God.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Wha...
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Picks up again just on the other side.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
What am I supposed to do?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Blow me.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Oh, that's fun.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Millionaires, man.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I heard it.
Just relax.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Get up off your ass and dig!
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
No!
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Shi'ites, I think.
With what?  Against how many?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Somebody has to.
Then I'm a rich man.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Really?
That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
I could use some recon photos too.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Okay.
I could.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Yeah.  So?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
If!  If there's a treasure.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Oh, Jesus!
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Stress category.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Looks like dirt.
No!  Don't go.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
AH UGH.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
What?
Why are you so concerned?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
That way.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No?
All right...
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Right.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Stay to your left.
Easy, guys.  
"Punks", huh?
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
People are dying.
Security.
Shut up!  Who is this?
But sir--
Shit. We're fucked.
Look who's talking, old man.
You don't fish.
Don't talk.
Huh?
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
And diamonds in the front.
Diamonds all over.
In a moment.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
About tonsils.
Amsterdam?
Yes!
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, Baron.
I want to see-- 
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Disappointed?
No, thank you.
Gaston!
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Two fifty-three, five--
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
By the way, how is your German?
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Yes.
I know that niche.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Ye-es?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Then a little nap--
Hair?
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
I know!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
For all the really important things--
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
But you're the more intelligent one.
Thank you, Rose.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
...Mrs. Calvert?
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
She knows.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
An accident?!
I was tired.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
It's okay. I'm alright.
I'll be right back.
Get in the boat, Rose.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
That's enough.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
Just tell us what you can --
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
Glad to see you again.
That's a date. 
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Okay.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I should say not.
She did?
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Back is in New York.
Cut it out.
Send that.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Are you happy?
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Very--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
So what?
What for?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
The country boy's about due.
I went for four.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
I sincerely hope so--
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Not now.  I don't have time.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
I asked where you got him.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Better.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Ignore her?
Sorry, sorry...
Never got to wear one of those.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
I laugh sometimes
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Doesn't suit you.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
I need it.
That what you got me up here for?
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
All right, run 'em off.
So he can tell the story.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Sure...
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Not all of us, 007.
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Fishing?
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Thanks.  Take care -
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
I'll keep that in mind.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He was my father's best friend!
No. I'm going with you.
If not?
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Yes -
- I told you! He was there! -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I will appreciate that.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
He is in his pigeon cage.
You know the man next door is near death.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
It is so considerate of you.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Bye, house.
Here!  In the car!
Rocky!  The ramp!
Excuse me.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Where?
Trouble?!  Where?!
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Go away.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Did I get my package in the mail?
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
No, no, no, wait!
I was close to being scared that time.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
I can't quite make out -- 
Uh-oh.

But you're Irish!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
You're not so old yourself!
I've got a present for you...
So had I.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, this is crazy.
How much do I pay him?
I got that.  How was your day?
Helena --
Oh, yes I can.
Parents still together?
Not like.  It is.
Nope.
Who do you work for?
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Not in...
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
The police won't find your car.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Your new friends.
What?
We keep our mouths shut.
We agree.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I have money --
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
No. On you go.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Shag her senseless.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
I guess you would, Franco.
Come on.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
No.
Following the game at all?
No. Me Neither.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
It was just an idea.
Well, it's up to you.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Went ballistic?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Are we leaving, Captain?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Yes.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
I am here, Captain.
"c."... "k."
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No. I refuse.
Spock...


You know I'm right.
I hide no pain.
Are you embezzling?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Let's get outta here.
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
It's too far!
Why? What are you going to do?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Recognizers!
It grows on you.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
You seem fine now.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
What?
Fourteen, Harry.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
You're welcome.
Here they come.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
I adore it.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
And you agreed?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.
Do you still love me?
No.  Much more.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Nope.
I didn't get any chicken.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
What do you do?
Burt Reynolds.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Uh-huh.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
You don't know him -
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Really?
Why Cancoon?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
Yeah.
No thanks.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
The zoo.
Yeah?
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What do you think, eightball?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I'm your son.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Nope.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
They didn't tell me.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Where'd you come from?
Absolutely.
Not a tiny little vial -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
What can I do?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Exactly room-mates.
Yes.
Where's that?
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
I need to go now.
You're afraid of germs?
July?!
1995?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No more drugs.  Please...
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
What's the matter with your leg?
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
See -- you can drive after all!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
I think I've heard that before.
You don't fear death?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
You Harlin?
Twenty-after-ten.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
How much!?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Genuine Draft?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Sheriff Potter.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
That a fact?
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Least you can leave.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
What?
I have ideas.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Have you ever been there before?
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
To get my car.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
What?
You killed him!
He was going to--
What for?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
John Stewart.
How do you know if you've never tried?
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Isn't that illegal?
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
How much could you get?
All I have in the world.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Not from where I stand.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What the hell are you talking about?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Give it to me!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Sure, Sheriff.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
Eh?
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
No police!
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Hell no!
More or less.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
A lot that means.
That's a solid name.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
How do you know if you've never tried?
I do.
I did?
What makes you say that?
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
No!
How about I pick one out for you?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Nothing.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
I got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Those are white words, not ours.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
How do you know he's still not here?
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Yeah.
Kill him.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
'Cause I love you.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I don't care, just get me there.
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
What does that mean?
Do you remember me getting sick?
What was that?
Was it serious?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
He's kind of a miracle.
Yes he is.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
I lied.
Get mom.
I see.
I'm not scared.
You're secret identity.  That man was right.
You're lying.
Fine.
Was your family traveling with you?
Did you get up from your seat?
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Like whores?
Innocent of what?
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days? I must be.
Yeah. See?
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
No?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Uh... Duke.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
But he was called...
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
He's... he's dead.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
Just SHOOT!
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
How far kin you see?
Yeah... you said that last night.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Thought you was followin' me.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
Yeah.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
I'm having a stroke.
Just forget about it.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Edie, please.
Umm ...
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Maybe more.
Who's Keyser Soze?
What if I
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What time is it?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
I work for Keyser Sate.
What about Redfoot?
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
What'the fuck is that?
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT.

Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
I don't.
I never heard of him.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
This is all bullshit.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Very good.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
...I was one of a group of...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
Just now...
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I thought I would need it.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
It's a common medical term.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Overruled...
This is Miss Costello...?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
The TV didn't work.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
That's what I'm going to try to do.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What are you going to do?
Where is he?
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
What?
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I don't want a mistrial.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes, that's correct.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Me, too.
Almost a year.
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Nothing.
She is not my wife.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Do you live here in the hotel?
What about?
Why?
Your name. And --
Who you are --
I'll take care of you.
Yes.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
Can't you see?
Why?
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Yes!
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
When?
I... didn't know where you lived.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
I enjoyed talking to you.
Why?
And no birds sing.
No.
When?
Yes --
Yes.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Oh?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
I thought so!
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Excellent.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
She's dead.
I have plenty of friends.
Just giving the facts.
What does that mean?
Don't talk to me about character.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
I got you.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Where is she?
Who?
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Nobody knows.
Go ahead.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He's having a problem here.
What?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Moore?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
They need leadership.
What do you mean, you think so?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Why what?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Are we going to do this again?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
Why? What's his problem?
I'm not. What's the problem?
You go down there.
I need your help.
I love you.
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
What are you talking about?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
Did she believe you?
I guess.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
I do.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Take your time. I wish I had.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
Give them to Refugio.
What about them?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
You have no feelings toward ...
Yes, it is.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
He was asking for it.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
That your cousin is more to your taste.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'll be ready.
She's left.
Things seem to be getting better.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
You little liar! Get out of here!
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Hello.
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
Me? What did I do?
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Not from in here.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Don't remind me.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
How should I know?
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Should I have?
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Relax. I know what you meant.
This isn't a game, Parker!
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Part of him is.
Sid?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I couldn't tell you.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
Can we have a white one, please...
Come on.
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Who's got the story? 
And you?
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Who would find out?
Who's gonna tell'em.
...they sound what?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
<u>Who</u>?
Why?
We'll be back tonight.
...I just hope...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
<u>So</u> forth...
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
...brazen-it-through...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Quite touching.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
...we own it?
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
Who're you working for?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
...uh ... No, that's...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Why would they want that?
We don't need an Act Two.
W...what?
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
...one more day.
Show Must Go On.
Why are they ...
Thank God this is America.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
You like it?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
...gimme some help...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Oh really.
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Hey the door was open.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
Don't start, alright.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Whatever night you like.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Get the hell out!
Why?
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Oh Christ!
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
You got it, G.G.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Hmm.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
No Jonathan.
What?  Tony and China, together?
I know what you mean.
Mom.
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
What do you think I should do?
What do you think?  Guess.
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
This really isn't a good time.
I don't know.
I have to go.
You're the flower lady.
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
And then you weren't there.
Yeah.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
We were suite mates.
It's niiice.
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Jody, no...
Telling you...
Jody, wait.
Something was there.  You saw it.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Adamant?
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
I can't believe this is happening.
Norman Spencer.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
You know what I mean.
After that.
To make sure she's all right.
It's what I've been working for.
Is it gone?
No, no.  It's fine.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Did you call the police?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Really?
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
What's going on, Claire?
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
The accident...?
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
The...
Since when?
Oh God...
You should have tried harder.
How can you be sure?
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Mauduh...
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
But you've not told Michael.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
Who the hel1 -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
He just went out like & light-
Like this...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
I LOVE him!
Do not tell me that!
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
I do not understand...
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
The one time I want it to work...
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
All I meant was -
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
That's GREAT!
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Michael!
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
You really love this guy...?
The one on the left - definitely...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
The touch?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
No thanks - 
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
I think you had better leave
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Yes, come on in...
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
Yes - of course.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Yes - one please.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
If you don't have...I mean...
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
That was code for "I like you."
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
It's okay. You need me?
Got it.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
That's me.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
You want it in writing?
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
In what sense?
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
Interesting.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
I know.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
I have only one concern...
You're sure?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Eat a power bar.
What about the blood?
And the child...
You mean he withdrew...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Suzie?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
And what do they say?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
You didn't cuff her?
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry?
Lombardo ever come out here?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Shit.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
Whichever one I want.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
I won't.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
You know what it takes.
Duquette.  Forget him...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
That's not your line.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
There's nothing for them to get.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
That's right.
Will they?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.
The one you bought at school.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
I'm going to hit you.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
My pleasure.
Thank you.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
Private train?
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Dr. Loveless?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
In an hour they're gone!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Then come with us.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Good.  How long will it take?
Absolutely!
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
She's a bird, Willow.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Kill him!
It's been a while.
What have you got?
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I was wrong.
But –
Only the elders.
How long?
But you can't.
Something wrong with buttons?
Listen to me – Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Oh.
That is idle talk.
You shame yourself.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
You'll be hist...
Oh ....
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Catch him, you fool!
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh --
Aw, come, come, come --
What's she doing now?
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
No --
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh! Oh!
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
Oh --
I knew you would!
Yes...!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
No, but you tried to.
The nerve.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Ohh!
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Where's Kansas?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Here -- here --
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Who at?
And you're going to lead us.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Hold still - hold still --
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
To Oz!
Dorothy!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
You know something?
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Yeah --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
With this?
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Perhaps after this ... test?
She’s not a girl anymore.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
What are you talking about?
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
What class sub does your nephew run?
Could...could you come?
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
What do you think?
Yes.  Au revoir...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Why?  What's the problem?
I would like to use the bathroom --
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Wrong answers?
Mm hmm.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
Jon -- what??
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.

Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Laurie --
Don't look.  Turn around.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Everything's changed --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Ever see one of these before?
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
But programmable. And expendable.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
Is this what you're looking for?
We have to find Magneto.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
How?
I'll go.
I felt like she almost killed me.
How?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
No!
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
One week at the most!?
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
No.
Fro-derick!
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Can you play it?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
I think you've done it, master.
Good night!
Nor to Elizabeth.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
There must have been someone else down here then.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Food!!
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
