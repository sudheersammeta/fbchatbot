Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Did you change your hair?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
He was, like, a total babe
You did what?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
And where're you going?
Wear the belly before you go.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
He seems like he thrives on danger
I thought you hated those people.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What's the worst?
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
We don't chat.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Are you following me?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Sure, I do
Who?
And I'm in control of it.
Busy
Unwelcome.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
The Partridge Family?
A soft side? Who knew?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Why can't we agree on this?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Right.
Say it
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Have a great time, honey!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
I don't want you to wait for me.
They took everything...
Father...
What does he say?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
What do you see?
Chief says -- how many?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
How did you manage it?
Father Marchena!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
New worlds create new people.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
What's your cut?  How much?
But it's...
What else do you need?
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Is he your boyfriend?
In the kitchen.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
What's he looking for?
Nah, why should you?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'll come with you.
Mind if I ride along with you?
I'll let you know what happens.
Two heads.
I'm serious here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
You're ruthless.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
That's good.
See you later.  Good luck.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Keep them out of my way.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
We are both from Prague.
You said speak Czech!
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Did you hurt her?
A job?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Viewer discretion advised!
A cheap hotel.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
CONTINUED
Yes?
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Really.
It's possible.
Oh?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Pay money?
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Hello, again.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Yeah.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Thank you.
Last night.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
There.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
What?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Yeah, I see her.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Which one pulled the trigger?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Hey, I don't believe it.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Three more hours...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Five bills.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
No thank you.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Leeloo's in trouble?
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I was talking to the cat.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
So, just how big was this fare?
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
You know how to fly this thing?
Why not?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Why?... Why would you need me?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Options.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What are these?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What the fuck... !
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
Excellent.
What are these for?
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
We do.
I want his name.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Look, you cocksucker...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
Of what sort?
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Shut up.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Wha... ?
What's this?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I'm not positive this means anything.
You're joking.
Hello?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Hello... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Her belongings?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
What the hell was that?
Something wrong with the stairs?
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Feeling better now?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Mommy...?
Hi, beautiful.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
There you go.  Love you.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
They think I'm nuts.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
What is it?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
So?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
Now they feel it...down below.
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
All ready?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
You might not kill it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Hmm.
Safety on?
This way.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Saw him do it?
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Why do they do that?
I guess they're stupid.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I called Mommy.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
No.
Where's the plow?
Huh?
Don't go playing policeman.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
On what you pay me?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Yeah.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
What way?
Oh, Wade.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
You're not using it today?
Coffee's perked.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Yeah.
Crawl!
You think Jack shot him?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Well, I never heard that one.
Wade, are you alright?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
*                     Please tell me your name.
What do you know of my husband?
Do you have to be so brutal?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
What's going on?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Thank you for calling the white House...
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
That just doesn't make any sense.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Roger.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to live anymore.
No.  Poached.  Over.
What should I say?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Ted!
But if you'll just give me...
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Oh, I can't stand it.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
That's right.
He didn't recognize me.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
How the hell do you know that?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Why did you do it?
Why'd I do what?
Who said that?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?

No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
What is it?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Who else can I ask around here?
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Could it be intelligent?
Amy.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Still nothing from the colony?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You're just reading me.
Thanks.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Mommy...Mommy?
Can we dream?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Indeed.
How do you know?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
What's that?
What?
Well, what does it matter to you?
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Now?
Why?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
Do you think that's funny?
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
No!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
There's a young girl to see you.
Well, ask her!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Who was that?
Frau Mozart?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Alone.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He's adorable!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Yes, indeed.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Where?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
German!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Well, we can.
Love, Sire!
Herr Sommer.
Do you have a daughter?
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I can't say. Really
With all my heart, Mozart.
How could I not?
Yes?
You flatter me.
What happened? Is it over?
Do you mean that?
No! No, it's him!
The man. He's here.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
And that's it. Do you have it?
You mean in Turkey?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Is the Emperor angry with me?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
And do they believe it?
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Here I am, my angel.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Yes, Doctor?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Dr. Hirsch?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Yes, Doctor.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Will you think about it?
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Yes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Don't you remember?
Hello, Benjamin.
No!
Miss Price.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
All right, you two, move along.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Two weeks?
Did you see Jack?
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
I heard that.
Pecos Bill.
Yeah.
I'll tell you when we get there.
You really scared me, you shithead.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What are you doing here?
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Do you have any hot soup?
No, thank you.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
Matt?
Whose death?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
You understand?
Thanks.
Well, you can. You always could.
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
What's this?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Oh!
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Helen!
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Yes, sir.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
If he can do it, yes.
You're lying!
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
What'll we do?
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Oh, ten dollars—
No.
Are you sure?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
wasn't anywhere near this place—
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Everybody in?
You can ride like that?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Where you boys going?
Not now.
She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Well?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Of St. Louis?
What the --
Mm-hmm.
That would have made an impression.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Yeah.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Uncle Frank?
Yeah Jimmy?
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Riders --
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
A river pirate.
Let the law --
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Hmm.
"Hmm" what?
Don't turn around.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Yes ma'am.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Mmm.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Thank you.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
So you can't tell me anything?
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Courtney? Dinner?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Yes.
You and...Luis?
Patrick?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
I want a firm commitment.
You're inhuman.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
But where?
How did you guess?
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Patrick? Is that you?
Late?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Sorry. 
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
...to the office this afternoon.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Shoot.
How old are you?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Yeah...Yale thing.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
And?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Is that a raincoat?
"Make" him?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
He's your boss. He's not your --
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I can't just walk away!
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Look at this.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
...wanna savor this.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Would you like a Coke or something?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Gary?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Cool!
Why would you do a thing like --
Do we post it on the Net?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
A what?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
You mean -- break in?
I don't know --
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Please don't go.
Meet me at the other location.
So how'd you like the house?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
You seem surprised to see me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Hungry.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
When do I begin?
Yes?
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
My wedding tackle.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
I am not.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Does that make you horny?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
I love you, Austin.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Is it one of ours?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Ow! You shot me!
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Quite impressive.
Sea bass.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
... preserve...
Fear ...
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
I have an appointment.
Then who wins?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
But
You don't trust me?
You lied.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Why?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Are you alright, young man?
The last one you'll ever see.
If you say so.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Five thousand dollars.
Not interested.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
About what?
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Ed... you're kinky!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
I don't know.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Thanks.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Brian.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Arson.
How's it going?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
-- I work for the city.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have a story.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Where are you going?
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Four months?
Every little boy's fantasy.
Nice boat.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Do you have to do that?
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Management were pin heads.
I was ahead of my time.
Dad!
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Okay.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Got a cause?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
You don't know... nobody knows...
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
"The Strawberries"?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
I forgive you.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
This psycho can.
What case?
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
He gots to be did.
Let's go niggers!
Who are you revolting against?
Delacroix.
We're ready when you are.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Nice to meet you.
We was coming to see you.
That ain't funny.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I'm wid it.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
I don't know about that plantation angle.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
This has to be a big mistake.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
How did you end up here?
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Where do you go from here?
Let's get him over to the bed.
Just want to say good luck.
So you have your small victory, now what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Please don't go there.
This is crazy.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Hi, Mona.
So they can be on TV.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
It looks delicious.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Oh her.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...yes she did.
...perfect...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
I don't know who I am.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Y'know what?
How did you get this gig?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Where are you bound for?
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Have you taken my message to him?
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Is he all right, papa?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I beg your pardon?
He loves me, as I love you.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
That son of a bitch.
I didn't shoot West --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
He said he worked there --
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
How do you know that?
Sir, yes, sir!
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
From up close or far away?
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
Is it the truth?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Ah, Christ
Is Dunbar cute?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You're kidding.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Why do you care?
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
They got their stories straight.
What?
I pushed him too hard.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
Four --
Think it'll work?
I should probably write that down.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
It won't work --
Wait --
Wrong answer --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Will.
How would you describe him?
In so many words, yes.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I'll...
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
So how does it happen?
You owe me three-fifty.
The river.
It's unbelievable.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
This is it? The whole vault.
'Fraid so.
I'm going to check on him.
What happened?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
I...
Oh nothing.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
What's wrong?
In the world.
Where's the restroom?
Have you got your passport?
No.
Sometimes.
Get out
No.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I don't want anyone to die.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Why?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Yeah, I know.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
This was very sweet of you.
More cough syrup?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Still need a lift?
What happened?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
You been home yet?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You take it straight?
Want another?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
How you feelin' today?
What I love.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Shit. Who hasn't?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
He tapped that.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Then what?
Why she got a chain on her?
You a preacher?
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
You need money again?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
I think she got to you, pappy.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
Frank Abolofia.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Nick... You up?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
What does Charlie mean?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Why the hell not?
What happened?
You must leave?
Know her?
What's he saying?
What'd I tell you?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
I'm not drunk...
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
I still think you're a bastard.
I'm amused.
Dope?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
I want a gun.
We're police officers.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
The families who control the casinos?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Let's go while there is still time.
I've done some questionable things.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
You're our best and only friend.
He's not ready yet.
Six, huh?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.
Yeah.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Not if it works.
Vodka!
Prosit.
I like you.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Too old.
Yes?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
I can imagine.
Who is this?
Did you cry when your father died?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
They could clean around the arrangement.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
How many questions did it take?
How do you know I'm not?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Pris.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Bravo!
You're kidding!
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
For how long?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Right.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Yes.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
See, ya.
Why doesn't it never work out?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
I don't want to be alone.
When do you need her by?
Yes, ma'am!
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
About clothing?
Yeah.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
I thought I was here to meet women.
What about her?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Hi, Eve!
I've got to go, now.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
What's baseball?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
1959.
This must be very new.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Yeah?
Almost all of them.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
I don't see anything!
Sure.
Say what?!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
This is your bedroom?
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Oh, my God!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Then after that it's safe.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Hi, honey!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
--and we will--
He's smart.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Always good advice.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
He left with Sophie.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
I've seen a few.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Why do you do it?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Well.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
Yes.
No. What is happening?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
What do you want?
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Dorothy. No!
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Frank?
Hello?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Alright.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay, yeah, call.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
You saw a lot in one night.
That's what I thought.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Okay.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Just for him?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Are ya ready?
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
We're alive.
What are you going to do?
How many?
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Aye.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So what are you thinkin' here?
The what man?
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Hey, Murph.
We'll keep going, Roc.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
Yes.
Don't do this my son.
What do you want me to say?
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Continue the joke.
What color hair does he have?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
This is he?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Where are you going?
But he didn't say anything.
Loop around real fast.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Can I get that credit card from you?
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
OK. Go ahead.
Inez, this is --
What the fuck is going on here?
They don't?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't think we can do that.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Shh.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
We've got sixteen dollars.
I know that. But --
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
He was a nice guy.
I'll see you there.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
Yeah.
You think Applejack knew?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
Where?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Exactly. Woah.
Who?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Let them fight.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
I'm not playing any more golf.
No.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Yeah.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Are you a fag?
OK, Bob.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I can't believe you said that.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I know it, man. Hang on.
26 weeks.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Well, I left some money in there.
No. I just have short hair.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
You Hoto?
Treadstone.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Berlin!
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
Pamela Landy?
Conklin up front.
I worry when you get like this.
We can't wait to be sure.
What?
But you found another choice.
You hear me? I believed you.
I killed him???
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Why am I alive?
Who's going? Us?
What? The tapes?
Still...
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Believed what?
Let's give him half an hour.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Are we hacking or asking?
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
He won't come.
Longshanks promised!
The Scots will fight for us?
I don't want to be a martyr.
They're coming!
Armed?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
No. He did not.
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Did it work?
Nor I!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Why did you?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I must... consult with my father.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
I don't know... I don't remember.
How long will I be in here?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Dad lives here?
Are you stupid or what?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
I deserve a lot worse.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Why are you doing all this for me?
Like how?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
And you are...?
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Hey, what'd you do that for?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Huh?
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Does he know that?
What is your name?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I won't.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
But why my name, Richard?
No.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Yes.
-- Is what?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No, Captain, please.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
Hello, Louis.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
It was a combination of all three.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Sacha, she's had enough.
There seems to be no secret about that.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Hello?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't want them here overnight.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Boss, let's get out of here.
Just a little something of my own.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Feels so good to lie here.
You've had today's water.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
No more water, you said.
Get water!
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Had a package to deliver.
You know, for when you travel.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
What's that?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
I most definitely say I am.
Yes, yes he did.
What happened to your pants?
The place is falling apart.
When'd you start working here?
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
What's going on down there?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
It's me.
I beat the odds!
Cool ropes.
To life.
That's what it's about.
Thanks.  For everything.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
What's she so emotional about?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
So. Not bored yet?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
How is that Wally doing?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
They wanted a girl.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
What kind of plane are you flying?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
They're migrants.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I'm stayin', Homer.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Nobody's named this one yet.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
That's *it*?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Keeping the Fix happy.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
We were back on.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Masters of our own destiny.
It can buy you a new and better you.
You know what we're doing with the money.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Why?
He's gone.
Lighten up.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
It's bad luck.
Why?
Escorts!
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
What?
What do you want?
To who?
It's just insurance.
Ouch.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
I found her in bed with someone.
Good night?
How did you land that?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
How did you know I was here?
Why did you take the money?
What?
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
So why did you come to my casino?
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Your father?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Absolutely not.
He doesn't gamble.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
The point is, they want a man inside.
What for?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
What the fuck are you talking about?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Five.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Very impressive.
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
Thanks for the information.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Hmmm...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Doolittle...
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Doolittle! Help me.
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
What is it?
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
But why can't we stay here?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
You're a thief?
Whoever that is.
Too early to tell.
It was open.
Bent.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You lost me.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
How much do you know?
I'm sorry.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Say the words, "I understand."
I understand.
You did.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
Then what?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Make the call.
I'm the victim here.
A toy?
What happens if you level with her?
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
He's sick.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
You love him?
What's that?
I-I c-can't...
Ann Arbor?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Namely?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
I found the Volvo.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Cool.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Yeah.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
I did?
Are you AFRAID?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Like a DeLorean.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
I'm not following you.
What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.
We went to a hotel.
Don't look so freaked.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
That's alright... I understand.
What's wrong with you?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Do they know yet?
Oh, shit!
Who's been giving you weird looks?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
I don't own a television.
I met a girl.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
But you were punished.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
If God exists?
Because I'm so horny.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
What's her name?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
What I think is going on with your son.
If that's what you think is necessary.
That's enough.
Christ. Is that an axe?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
My mom wanted me to have this?
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Here, I didn't get any.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
And wear a crown and everything.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
What kind of a dog is he?
Yankee Poodle.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
It must be done right away.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Go ahead.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
No, that wasn't it...
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
I've always thought that myself.
Did it go well, darling?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Don't!
He fell.  He falls.
This man belongs in hospital.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
I don't understand.
Treves. Well done.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
What is it, Treves?
I am very pleased to meet you.
How long has this man been here?
Three quarters of an hour.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
How awful for John.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
My name is...
John... Merrick
...Yes potatoes... but...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Yes.
How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.
Who are they of?
The children! May I see?
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Fine.
I've heard.
The workhouse.
Won't come out, eh?
A dressing bag.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Well... where is he?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
I shouldn't have come.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
How?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
But you don't want to hear it.
REALLY?
We're just not a very musical nation...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Yes... oh, yes...
But it IS! Look!
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
You DON'T like it, do you?
What's wrong with making friends?
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
You mean we'd be dead?
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Row!
You'll be sucked down too!
Wait, Erik!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
He hasn't.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
You know, my son, our lord said...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Thanks, guys.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Really?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Rockville Center.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I'm Joel.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
So you like bookstores, huh?
You pick it.
Yeah, I guess.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
I don't think we're ready.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What if you hide me?
What?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Joel!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Right. Something black though.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I dropped you off after. You said --
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Not yet. Not married.
I remember that speech really well.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
I don't know.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Hi, it's Joel.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
It's them.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Clementine.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh! Great. That's great!
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Well, what should we do?
You better go.
Oh.
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
You made me have an abortion.
Mary. What are you doing here?
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
A traveler, eh?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What are you doing?
I was a successful model once.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
The containment, Second Containment...
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Is that an offer?
How is he?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
What's wrong?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
Does he know that?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
What about it?
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Don't... don't do this...
You... You can't do that!
Weir is dead.
Jesus...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
We've got some weather.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
No. It was someone else.
First time in a grav couch?
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He's engaged the override.
Almost got it.
What the hell is that?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Get them back --
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Those yours too?
About me? How sweet.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
It's about to be a broken face.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
And if he's not...?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
Ben did this?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Oh, I think you already have.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
On the ledge?
This is how I dress all the time.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Is everything okay at work?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Well... it's true.
I don't know. I was just curious.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
I don't know.
You first.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Hey, Rat.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Did you go home and get it?
Yes.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
No way! He just called him a dick.
You'll always remember your first time.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Does that ever happen?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
I want romance.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
You better save some for me, you swine!
I don't know. I guess so.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks for picking me up.
How about the point?
We keep them.
Do you want to come inside?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
No. That's okay.
I don't know.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Two Cokes.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Crying? Why was she crying?
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Dobermans don't talk.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Where'd you get that knife?
What limes?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Jesus.
Plans?
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Right!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We should go! We should go right now!
Stop it.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
What tunnel? Where?
Where's the tunnel?
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Just an observation.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
You weren't helpin'.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Why do you take shit from him?
Yep.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What's in the back?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Keys.
I wouldn't do that, son.
'Eh, Chief?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Get to your cars!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Well...
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
'Forgive'...? For What?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
My clothes?
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
I'm not!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Frances.
What does Clifford say?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Without me.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Bye, baby.
You wrote it, didn't you?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Good.
Not me. But other people seem to.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Harry.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
...So you think I should go.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
How the hell do you find me anyway?
I'll bet.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Frances, You're crazy.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Fine!
I live here.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
I don't care.
Then why did you bring them?
Say you promise.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
This whole thing is a joke!
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Yeah?
What?
You were with him at the end.
You drove him to his torment.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
I see it before me.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
So have I
God took her from us.
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Your decision. For us.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I thought I'd never see you again!
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Professor?
Henry Clerval.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Now you've got him started.
You can't. Death is God's will!
No. He had more important work.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Paracelsus?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You want to leave?
It still hurts?
Trouble?
Jack?
Marcie?
I'll be along.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Best over...
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Have you ever been there before?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
I'm exhausted.
What's your name?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Not a chance.
Where is the little lady?
Yes, she is.
Yes.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
What did you call me?
To your family.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
It's the bitterest of pills.
What do you think Mom would say?
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
What's in Mexico?
What did I say?
Yes.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
You believe me don't cha?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have a waterbed?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Where's the woman?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's what you look like.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Yeah, it's mine.
Who's "we"?
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
I'm fine, sir.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
White House boys want a private meeting.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
You'll think about my offer?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Just do it, okay?
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Me?  Why me?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
I don't know, I don't care.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
And how do you know that?
Who is it?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Sure, sure.
32 feet, six inches!
Say again, sir?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Do you?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Say again?  How many micks?
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Clear.
You knew about us?
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Are you okay?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Mr. Caiman...
That is our job.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
We've met before.
Are you sure? How do you know?
So you're in?
What's with the chewing gum?
Who the hell are you?
I understand.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
At ease men.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
You go first! There's no time!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Not again...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
A boy comes to the door.
May I get the check?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Lt. Madison, GO.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
...The digital conveyor.
It's suicide.
Where are the miners?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
It's... I don't know.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're doing episode 31?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
There's nobody here. Jason...
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Right.
Gwen...
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Unbelievable.
Closer?  I can try.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Home.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Weapons storage...
You what?.. What are you talking about?
But...Why?
Do your best, Tommy...
Find them.
WHAT? WH
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Is that a fact.
The army needs you.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
We've got powder but no ball!
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
Yes, I believe so.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
General Lee is detained captain...
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
The man is a traitor!
You must be very rich.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Martha!  For God's sake!
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
What the hell are we doing?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, this must be about something!
George, you know I only love you, but...
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Africa, of course.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
You get life for kidnapping.
So you didn't have the key with you.
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
That's all there is to it, huh?
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
How'd you get in here?
Sovereign.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm a producer.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Have we met? I don't recall.
That's what I'm doing.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
You pack a gun?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Here's your keys, Harry.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
Yeah, he told me.
Personally?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
One we're producing.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
How about this?
Who told you that?
How'd you know I was here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Why not?
You sure?
You don't act like it?
That's what the guy said.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
What a spectacular view.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Harry -–
What money?
A passenger liner. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Let's not be too hasty.
One more?
What?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Maybe that is his boat.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
What's slow?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
You okay?
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
Are you sure?
You sure it wasn't me?
You just shoot at something?
The ah... the radio's out.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Not our mystery guest again.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nope.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Of course they did.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
You're kidding, right?
Will you get off my back for once?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What are you trying to say?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
It's not optional!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Are you the one who left that note?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
That's just the way I am!
How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Hey Josh.
What?
Why?
Much later.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
What is this?
Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I want to do him!
Which loser?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
This is way too creepy.
"Funky"?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
It's a surprise.
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
You're gross.  See that guy?
You're just jealous.
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Don't worry.
Do you want to do something tonight?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
What happened to Seymour?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
When was this?
Great...
What time?
Wow... finally.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
How much is this?
Seymour does.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Tell me what?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Hi... what's your name?
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
A dollar seventy-five.
NO!!!
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
Where did you get this?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I'm just being realistic.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
That slut!
Did she say that?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
How; we don't know where they are?
You've never built in Africa.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Starling?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
Understand, I had help-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
How lucky we are.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
But you said they were always old.
What did I do?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
That's very considerate.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
For you.
I do, actually; very much.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Certainly.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Good luck.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Can I help you?
What is it, honey?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
I know.
Then why have you come?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Hello, Venkman.
You were supposed to help me with this.
From where -- Neptune?
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
What's that?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
What's your story, Pete?
I'm ready.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
No, I just thought --
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Wonder what?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Uuuuuuugh!!
Is it a star?
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Is that a game?
In the physical sense.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Are you Peter Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, Egon?
Where's the Keymaster?
What do you mean by "seen?"
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
So do I.
Who was the architect?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
I want that bastard dead!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
I am their hero!
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Take grain away from the army?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Would that Marcus had lived.
Where are they?
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
They fear me.
What the hell was all that about?
You need to come home!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
No.
I want to go home.
Where we going?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
You sure you really want to?
Elaine --
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Is it because I'm here?
Let me go.
Don't tell me --
No.
I don't know.
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Oh no. He said that.
Exactly how do you mean?
Who screamed?
What for?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
What?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is what a girl?
Will you take me home?
All right then.
What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
What?
What's wrong?
It's all right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Jesus Christ!
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
Well -- goodbye then --
To tell you?
Yes.
What?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Will you bring me a hanger?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
That you're afraid --
If you want.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
What novel did you read.
Him?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We don't.
No we don't.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Not exactly.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Oh my God.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
I see.
Don't start acting hurt.
But it's not.
You don't have to say that.
This is absurd.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I'll find her.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
-- worried?
About what?
To be what?
I've got to go.
Thank you very much, sir.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
You'll never be young again.
What?
Quite a while.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
But why?
Hello.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Like dancing?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Reducing?
Chasing around.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
You are beautiful!
You do believe that I really love you?
Why later?
No?
On the train?
We could come to my room.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well -- last night was not so good.
I must have made a mistake.
For me?
For me?
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Everything?
Oh, I've got to find it.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, don't go.
Please -- please!
Yes --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
What?
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Definitely off.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Tomorrow morning.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Can you pay some attention to me?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
I know you did -- I said you did --
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
You see -- what we are interested in --
I can't dance tonight --
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Pretty as a picture.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Yes, yes, but that's --
What is?
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
It's not your fault.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
What? Me?
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Perk, remember?
What happened to your hand?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
I tripped over a chair.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
At what?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
This time...
Scram. Go home.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
Working the what?
I've heard the name.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
He retired.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
What?  What for?
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
What's that?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
What?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
That's it?
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Checking out your place.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Why not?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then I'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
I'm okay.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
It's John, isn't it?
What is it?
What's this?
Ooooh, busted.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Thanks!
He do that to you?
Why?  You interested?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Promise?
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Come on!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Why did you take Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Oh, shit.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I didn't tell you everything.
What'll you do for transportation?
You ever own a motorcycle?
How do you know that?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Everybody thinks that.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
What an awful sound!
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
What?
We got to get another pilot.
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
He worships Father.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College?
He insults him all the time.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Gee whiz, Dad--
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
You don't even know me.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
People don't use that word any more.
What then?
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Go on.
I don't think so.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Did you like it, dear?
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
How do I load?
Ooops.
He's dead, you know.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
This is man to man.
Hands and knees, you say?
I'm an honorable clown?
Poison.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
For what?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
So long, you guys.
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
Ja?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
I don't want to live any more.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
I know.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Don't know.
Mom?
We don't have a maid any more.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
That's something I suppose.
I'm glad.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Is he all right?
What was it?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Why would you do that?
They didn't murder me.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Wait?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Three hundred?
When do we start?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
At least I'm a growing person.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
It's not quite the same thing.
She left you right?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Granville?
You are.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Yeah.
What are you paying me for?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
The police? They know less than you do.
Yeah. Probably.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, do me a favor.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
What you got in mind?
Who told you about this?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's an investment.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
I don't know.
What's that?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
I'm a file clerk.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Harold Chasen.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you sing and dance?
Yes.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Why not?
I'm sure picking up on vices.
What was that?
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Yes. They're old friends.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
To whom?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
No. My uncle.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Thank you, Uncle.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
That's right.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Well, I didn't.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
He... he loved me.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
He talked about Demons, huh?
Who?
Story of my life.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
I thought you liked being on TV.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Those things never work. Never.
-- should go back. Now!
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
He -- loves you.
Just take it slowly.
Julia's my second wife.
We've got such sights to show you --
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
No.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
Frank --
Julia.
No. God no.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Maybe we should just leave --
Kirsty? It's very late.
No, damn you --
Where are you?
Oh baby.
Please...
Just soda.
You want something to drink?
Is Julia here?
Really?
He's gone.
You know I do know the way home.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
You gotta be kidding me.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
How do you know about that?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
None.  Christ!
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Well what about the new Echo --
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
Nothing.
Who are you going to see?
Anna Moss.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Pardon me?
Is there a difference?
Hey Charlie.
Huh?
No, that's okay.  Really.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
What's this?
Rob.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
What?
Did you say something?
I suppose so.
It sounds stupid.
Is what better?  Better than what?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Pigsty.
Look, are you coming or not?
I don't want to go back.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
Laura...
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
C'mon.  I want to know.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
You're tougher.
I'm alright.
You're being stupid.
WHAT?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
Fair enough.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
What difference does it make?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
I'm sure it isn't.
Oh, right.  Alright.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
I'll call you.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
She left.  She's gone.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
Thirteen hundred.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Huh?
Happy birthday.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Do you play?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Have you gone to the police?
I'd rather hear yours.
You did kill those men.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
You have lived forever.
Now there's a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
What do you want from me?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What were you doing in Felton?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
-Et lux perpetua-
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
You know me home.  Me name.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Does it change with me in the room?
You feel you know me.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
You are still so very young.
Aye.
How can I stop such a man?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Go to hell.
Impotent cow.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
No doubt.
You're wrong.
Finish your prayers?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
What is your position?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
It can be different.  It must be.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
_Answer_ me.
How did you find me?
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
What are you getting at?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
You're a kind man to be sure.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
The resemblance is amazing.
The poem?... The poem was great!
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Well, I'm independent, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Save that for the Tribune.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
What do you mean by that?
I know, Walter, but I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
What's the matter?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
I'm not working for any other paper!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
What's his line?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
You said it.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Never mind that. What's the story?
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Where's Bruce?
Look at me, Hildy --
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Don't open that!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Flip a coin.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Walter!
Anything you want, Boss.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
I call. What you got?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Boy, did you see her go?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
That's murder!
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
We'll fix that, too. 
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Who is it?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
You know it is!
That man there!
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Who? Me?
The City Sealer's office!
Is it hard?
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
What's your hurry?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I never was.
You want to join our gang?
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
...and four and five...
Can't we just see the end?
Crocodiles! Aah!
But Dad, It's the News.
It's like telling fibs.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
And absent bridegrooms!
We don't know anything about it
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Up to six weeks, I think.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Father, that's enough now
What did I do to deserve this?
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
No, really.
The Duke?
I don't drive cross country.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
She looks like she stinks.
Thanks.
What I need are some answers. 
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Hmmmmm.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Yeah?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
You got to be fucking joking.
I don't hear anything.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
That's the understatement of the year.
What do they call you, sweety?
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Sorry.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Where's Bill?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
That's it?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hello, my little boy.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
No.
My apologies, madam.
Progress!
Ouch. Yeah?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
One night stand?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
It looks wonderful.
Of course.
Fifteen.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
I don't know. Something.
Your entire body?
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Do you like my new look?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
You were gone a long time.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Puff, put the gun down.
No, why?
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Mother?
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
How?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Cash.
I'm buyin'.
Pool.
You being cute?
I got drunk.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
I never saw you do anything else.
You know everybody, don't you?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
I told you you'd get your money back.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Couple of bucks.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Long wait for a bus?
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, not always.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Okay. So what's your name today?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
No, why should I? It's yours.
Do you want me to go?
What are you writing?
What's this supposed to mean?
Well, what else does?
I love you.
Well, what's so funny?
No, I want to walk.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Your shot.
You lived like this once.
Yes.
I only protect myself -- !
Do you still want me to stay?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Need some gas?
Why, Dad?
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
I swear it was here.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
You're looking for life?
George, where have you been?
What?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
You're being paranoid.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I take it you've heard.
Love was never our problem.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Pops!
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
What the hell is that?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It had been deemed classified.
Your son.
He's my angel.
But I gave you some this morning.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
What about you?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Where did this come from?
An old man's dream.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Mine, too.
This.
What are you going to do?
Out!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Dad, how can you?
I'll take the camels.
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You have insulted my son.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Oh really?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
What street?
Yeah?
Right.
Who are you?
Yeah...Who?
Are you threatening me?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Anyone there?
What'd he look like?
Now what?
I don't know...To get Al.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Now what.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You need ID in there?
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Use my credit cards.
Why not?
You'll be me.
Eating sushi?
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Where is she staying?
What happened?
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
It worked.
What is it?
Much too blue.
Which one is she?
I feel like an idiot.
What is it, your charm?
It's embarrassing.
You got any books in there?
You shut down your sensors.
And on my time.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Don't you think I stand out like this.
What do I do?
Follow her.
Come on, she's getting away.
Just stay here and rest.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Ow!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
He was with Gruner!
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I didn't do anything.
They have stolen state property.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
You have nothing...
What things?
Fine. You look fine.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Don't you want to get out?
Take the card.
Now you know what I know.
Blake?
I'll be right there.
Wait. What's your name?
You again.
You are.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
What did you tell them?
You work for Ryuji?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
One chip?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Are you alright?
They asked about you.
You can say that again. What do we do?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
How?
Do something!
It was you.
Riuji?
Why are you on to him?
What about the others.
Why?
It is?
Tear it apart?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Yes, baby?
Monday.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Good.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Okay.  Lowell?
Is there any more rice...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Yeah, I'm here.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
What?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Give me a break!
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
...okay.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
I told the truth!
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Just give me an example...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
What are you talking about?
Where you staying now?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Triple!
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
What?
Thanks, buddy.
Yes?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Why do you think she did it?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
What does your lawyer think?
You don't believe in it.
He wants a reconciliation.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
But why him?
So I hear. Is that all?
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
Screw you, asswipe!
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
She held that against you?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
I don't have a ring!
But?
What do you want?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
You can't prove anything.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You have to leave the house immediately!
I fell in love Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Is this Ming?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
So what?
Herb wants to see me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...arty farty!
Did Marylin end up with money?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Mr. Rexroth.
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Mm.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I'm not sure.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Oh—Mary—
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
What ten thousand?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
No.
Oh, come now—
I don't know.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
I'm sorry you read it.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Yes, sir.
No.
What do you think you're doing!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Your ego is colossal.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Where is the shower?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Oh, Peter— 
know—but—
What if nobody stops for us?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Here comes a car!
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
No harm in your coming to see us.
Not interested. 
Why, he'll be back.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Get out!
What time is it?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah.
What!
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Then—you'll have to git !
Zeke.  Git!
Thanks. 
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
What?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Who?
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
No, I did not.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Dave?
It leads farther than that.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
I had the cause of death.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
David Ferrie.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Well, thanks for coming.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
More than ten years.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
She's the best damn witness we have!
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Six.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
But then you told her you were home.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
She sound scared?
Can I have a word with you?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
I gave you my card there.
You gain weight?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
With ten thousand? Nine.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
Who is this?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He came by.
How do you get it out?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
Bigger?
I walked right past you.
Catching a movie.
Does it happen to all men?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Will Ordell go for that?
I called you last night.
What do you do when he comes home?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
What's he doing?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
What if I plead guilty?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
He sells guns.
I'm recording this.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Yes. All those things are true.
I thought I did.
He said he didn't know about it.
Jackie?
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I understand woman, damn!
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
A woman.
Can you cover that?
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
When did you get out of jail?
How long?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Were you a disco guy?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
We're leaving now!
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I'm in my underwear.
I didn't look like a bum.
How much is there?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
What does that mean?
It's Louis.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You know how she is.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
House or apartment?
I can see that. Why?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I'm alone.
How the fuck did he find me?
She's been there since Thursday night.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
She's all alone.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
He ain't here right now.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Then what are you doing here?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
I see.
Are you all right?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Short? It's ended.
Well, try, huh.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Wait ... Daddy.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
I can't relax.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
It's freezing.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
They stole it.
What do you think?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
No. The little one.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Jake!
What's it say? A hundred and two?
I know.
Remember that.
He did? When?
Don't!
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You've lived with me for two years.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Don't be funny.
This isn't happening.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I don't know.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I no from around here.
You got a nice tan, though.
He's burning up.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
Everywhere, like a plague.
The army?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Is he all right?
You got lucky.
He's not part of the program.
What?
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Hurry!
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Jesus, God!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Okay, good tip.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
My cars. And a comic book.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
I know who he is...
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Probably out in the back yard.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Older, sillier.
Where is he?
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
He lost it on the way up.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
He ate a car?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
This has got to be one big violation...
You here for the summer?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Twenty years.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
He's busy.
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
What do you see?
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Whose idea was it?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
But you copy my work every week.
Really? What are they like?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Mine too.
Can we make out now?
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear it's yours?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What? I'm not made of stone.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Nails? Really?
Hon, did you get expelled?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Oh.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Hey, I like this.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
I actually know this one.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Oh, okay. Like this.
No?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Your name, please?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Hi Dad.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Yeah, she does.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Hm.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
She answered our prayers.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
No.
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
...I said, I like your hair.
You took this picture?
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Early, what're you doin'?
What's wrong with her?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Yeah.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
I still think we should have met them first.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Fuck!
There's more...
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...That'd be my guess.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Yeah.
Oh. You like her?
Darcy?
I don't understand why you do that.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
How old are you?
You're OK?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yep.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
It's like...
Yep.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
You've heard the stories right?
No. I was just kidding.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
When are you gonna be back?
It's me. Telly.
I can't man.
Morpheus.
The door was open.
No.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
What do you mean, stand out?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Who is this?
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
You sonofabitch!
Yes?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Feeling better?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
What are you doing up?
It isn't Kathy.
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
The most logical choice.
Did you see his face?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
That's it?
About what?
What do you see here?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
No.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
They couldn't break the riddle.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
Another kind of game?
That's not fair!
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I'm sorry.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
What's wrong?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
You're right.  The killer told me.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
We're almost married.
Lyssa ...
I will find you. I will be with you.
I won't leave you here.
Turold's son was to marry her.
You choose these?
I can't reach her.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
The spiral begins in the west.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
No! You cannot know that!
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
Am I not worth returning to?
Yes.
Even by you?
I cannot betray my bride.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Well, I'm not impressed.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go. I command you.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
No.
Sugarballs?
We meant only to please you.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Put me down, you lout!
Oh, my poor stew!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
The Widow of the Web?
Who speaks that name!
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Knowledge.
Of what?
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Who'll I aim at?
May I go to the cinema?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
It's too big.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
How many girlfriends did you have?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
...Who sent you?
No...
This smells good.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Okay.
It's a special day isn't it?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
I don't know.
Why there?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
I thought you were asleep.
You tell stories?
What was that?
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Yes.
I'm walking there Kris.
She knew you loved her.
Why know?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Where am I?
Hello!
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Are you serious.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Me neither.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Where have you been?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
But it's a top three school --
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Are we done for today?
What?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
What's going on?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
No.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
You can't go home!
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
You almost had me fooled.
What?
Yes, you are.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Power yoga?
Neat.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
I can't.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
What the hell is that for?
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Projecting joy is not my job.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Are you asking me on a date?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I got bangs!
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Well, yeah, but --
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Fool's magic.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
God protect me.
You... you're a beast!
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
No more... please...
You're a beast!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Who might these friends be?
Gump, is it?
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
But... but, why?
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
There isn't much time!
It doesn't matter.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I detest serpents.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
What have I done?
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Pinching?  Where?
Step lively now!
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
I don't believe you.
How so?
And sweet?
Please...
Lost?
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
And video games after!
When does George get to come see his house?
And why was the alarm on?
Don't you have school?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Did you feel anything?
What did you think it would be?
You should stay.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I'm coming in.
Why are you so stupid?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
You hate your father.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I don't wanna go.
Why is that?
It could have been a squirt gun.
A sink?
You're here early today.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
This has got to stop!
I'll ask.
Why would you be there?
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Nothing.
That's not true.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
I was parked in day parking.
Money?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I used to live here.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
With your hands or your tongue?
You brought your kids?
You bit my finger.
You got any weed?
Don't even...I'm there.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
What are you doing home?
These are free papers.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
But you can't.
No, but...
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Yeah...
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Engagement ring!
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
I've never seen you in here before.
That's because I've never been here before.
Don't I know you?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
That's right, a loan officer.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
That jelly you were talking to right here?
What are you talking about?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
No, man. I want you to have it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Don't mention it.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Him?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
Crawfords.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
That was five years ago.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Yeah? You and what army?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
How about some steak sauce?
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
Is everyone here?
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Blacks welcome there?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Is this a joke?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
All these good people have totally been led astray.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
What's Nicky doing down there?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Hello.
You got the wrong window again, man.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Why would you be floating?
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
I love you.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Off limits.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
What's going on, Logan?!
When do you go up?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
And now?
I'm listening.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
What're you going to do?
I wish I could help you.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.
What?
Maid? Relative?
Can I call you?
It's me...
Okay...
Pornos.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
I don't. I don't know him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Okay. Thanks.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Where is he now?
What about yesterday?
I won't ever tailgate.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
Good book, huh?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I had a dream about you last night...
You're up early.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
It'll be ready.
Mr. Eddy?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Sheila?!
What do you want?
Oh, read it!
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I see.
Yes!
I'm thinking.
The police?
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Yes.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Think of it! In times like these.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Cave, eh? Where?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
108 and still active?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Why, no.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Are you the High Lama?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Mine?
You?
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
George, what do you think you're doing?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Why not?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
That was easy. I read your books.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
You see, it's not a dream.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Why?
Why, mother?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
What do you want him to do?
Why, he's speaking English.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
You'll wait till you rot!
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
I guess I lost:
And if I say yes?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
I wasn't scared...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Right.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
You don't know me at all.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
What if he's telling the truth?
Kay--
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
What are you doing?
What do we do?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
They're not my pals--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
He's gone, too.
They're gone.
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Oh, God...
The other two will die without me.
What --
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
That's not much.
How do I find the --
You the only sentry?
Uh-huh...
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I go running down there.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
And who the hell is that?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
What?
Red Ball?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Come on!
You gotta have faith, Dad.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
What about the picture --
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
The guy from USA Today is here.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Cream and sugar.
That was our apartment.
But John was with him at the pool?
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
I can take you down there.
As far as...?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Oh no. What is it this time.
What the fuck was that about?
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Bullshit.
I don't know.
Honey?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
When's it going down?
Where is this happening?
Ruiz tied in out there?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
This is it.
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
I'll work it off.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I know.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Where's the drop?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. Just the cross streets.
Ricky's taken care of.
Ruiz isn't here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What about it?
What are you saying?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Fuck them.
I think we might.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Is that the woman from..?
What's the movie?
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Who you calling?
C'mon, man...
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
What exactly did they say?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Where do you think you're going?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're getting whacked.
C'mon, man...
The what?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Dude, we were practically made...
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
I'm half Irish.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Coke?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Here they are, then.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
Keys.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
We're square.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Dip?
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
What they call you?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Keeps me out of the army.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I don't want your money.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Where am I gonna start?
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --

"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Could we sit down someplace?
I'm in Detroit.
I'm not made of glass.
I just want to sit here and be still.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Dear heart, I love you.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Let him finish.
Yes, sir, I did.
I better not come in.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
You want to be the head man?
Who the hell are they?
Am I a suspect?
So you are going to talk me to death.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[South America.]
So what do I get in return?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
[Who are you?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Is it loaded?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
How long you staying, Crease?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I'm a bargain.
Not at all?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
The gunshot holds no fear.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Planned what?
Rosanna Guerrero.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I think it's nice he's American.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
What? Who?
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[Who's that?]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
It must be one o'clock.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
What they say?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Were the lights on?
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
No...
You got an elevator in this house?
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Where you going now?
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
What time is it?
Don't worry about it.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
What, Ma?
Hey, Ang'...
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Sure.
Well...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Never this close.
That's right.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
The chest-cutter.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Never mind. Forget it.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
I don't feel anything.
He only lasted one season.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
See you.
How did you get called that?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Very happily married.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
They missed the boat.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Just in dreams?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I have not understood what you means.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Yes, sir?
Did you get it, too?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Oh. Yeah.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Ted Sheldon.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
All set, Ann?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
You made it up.
John Doe.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Well, I don't get it.
How about family? Got any family?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
It's good to see you. Sit down.
It's for Ann . . .
Oh!
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Is there a crowd in the street?
I don't know.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I won't get away with it.
Hi, Roper.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
What's the suspect's name?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
How did you like Toronto?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
You have to. It's a tradition.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
You tell me.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
How much you wanna bet?
How long you been coming here?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Greg.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Maybe you should be.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Korda escaped.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
You let us worry about that.
What do you think would be in order?
I want to be put on this case.
Any verification on numbers.
Are these yours?
Okay...
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Who are you?!
No.
You were the one who was dying.
Unfinished business.
You're jumping to conclusions.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
What?
What did he tell you?
The truth.
You went to my high-school?
I know.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Male.
Access established.
What?!
Wow.  Sand.
I heard that!
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Here you go!  No pushing!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
What do you mean "basically"?
NINJA APE ZORD!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
So what happened?
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
He was around...
Bastard didn't even show.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You ain't even a man yet.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
You here with Bobby?
I needed to see you again.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
You bastards, I said twenty!
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
Come off it, Bugs.
He's trying to make it.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Not stupid. Fat.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And the Jews?
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Kill them! Kill them!
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Who did this?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
The ring...
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Stu...Stu...
What?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Who told you we deal drugs?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I don't want to talk about it.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Aaron?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Mm hmm.
Where to?
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
You got worms.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Good idea. When?
Do we *have* to?
What?
What?
You said it!
Huh?
Diz!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Oh--oh.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
*You won't?*
What!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Jeff for Senator.
Thank you, sir.
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Y-yes.
Mr. President--
Oh, now--
Hello, Jefferson.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Did you say--bus?
Whose statue is that?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
A *day*!
How?
Committee.
Good. Where are we?
The Steering Committee.
Since sixteen or so.
I also answer to whistles.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Second drawer.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Yay!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Well! You don't say!
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Nice *compliment*!
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
How nice.
That's going to be fun.
Who's that?
They think he's pixilated.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
I haven't.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Are they true!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
What's that got to do with it?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
That depends on what they see.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What's that?
Really?
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
A girl?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
How'd you get the picture?
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
That's the rub.
Boy, was he burning.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Gold, eh?
Fourteen carat?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Better wire him right away, John.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
It's a lie!
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
You can't?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
No?
I've got one for Cobb—
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
No, I mean - about my client.
Proceed.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Where is your farm?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Looking for?
Who?
But she's on the telephone—
Why are they ganging up against me?
You can go out there if you like...
Mr. Cook.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
A little.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
It was Henry Follett.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
What do you want to know?
And the Brocketts?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
You're good.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Oh... not a real doctor.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Finally, some common sense...
No, I really don't.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
What?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!
Is this the treatment?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Which thing?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
You feel violated?
But...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you think about it?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I've got three big ones.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Don't you like this?
Good-looking woman.
Hey, Skip.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
That'd be Lily.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I'm honored.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Sorry...
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Yes... your particular approach.
Who the hell are these guys?
None of the above, thank you.
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Proceed!
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You two!
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
No... Why?... Should I?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
You called me your girl?
Have you no respect for the dead?
I was mistaken.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
What do you suppose killed him?
Hey,... don't I know you?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
None taken.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Um-hmm.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Atta, girl!
He was cute though.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
Sounds good to me.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Come here.
Stay away!
It's me.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Cover me!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Or flowers.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
You guys going to a costume party?
Are you famous?
Not yet.
Wow.
Here you go. 
I use it... to fight evil.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Who are they?
Sorry.
The who?
To us!
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Yes -- who spoke up?
Any cannon?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Read it back.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Does your mother know you have come?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
Ah, that is good.
May I offer you a drink?
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
She must have been in love with you.
I cannot promise you that.
Promises mean nothing.
Will you be joining us, soon?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
That's all I can say.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
You couldn't face telling me what?
God help me -- yes.
Can you give me a drink, please?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
I know you smoke weed, right?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
No I'm not.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
What's crackin'?
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Why?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
What we gonna do?
No.
Wait.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
I did.  Is that door locked?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
That the big one, huh?
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
20 minutes?
What you say?
What?
I can't feel my legs no more.
Hey, what's going on?
What?
Where'd you come from?
San Diego.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
What?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Nods.
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Will you promise me that?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
What are you supposed to do?
Meet Irene.
You're going to go see her.
What are you going to do!?
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
A surprise?
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Yes, Dad.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
O, she's all right.
Don't!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
The money, Icey.
You go set down by the River.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Tell me what, boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Don't you believe me?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
O no! Your turn!
Pearl and John.
No, Harry! I thought --
I -- no, I --
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
None of your business, Madam.
You'll whip me!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
No.
The killer.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
She lived there.
Right home after.
You okay?
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Give me the key, mother.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
And then what happened?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Nice to have a fire.
From Leon.
Aren't you late?
What are you serving?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
We don't want to be disturbed.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
What's new?
Yes, Comrade.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Confess what?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
No visa.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Yes.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Do you hear that?
Thank you.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
What?
Will you smile?
Just smile.
Why?
Then you should go back to your table.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
I don't look too foolish?
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Go on.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Yes, sweetheart. 
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
What did he say?
You haven't seen her yet?
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Has done what?
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
I told you to go, madame.
Where are they?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Where is it?
My jewels?!
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Pay him.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Why not?
We can't touch Hoover --
Sorry ...
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
That's what they're doing.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
Sir, the deadline is today.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Where are they?
You never told him?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
What about the documents he promised?
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
I never met the man.
You'll win the nomination.
The White House.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
That was Mr. Kennedy.
How about Kissinger along with him?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
How many?
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
You all right?
It broke my heart when Harold died.
You're shittin' me.
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Proud?
It makes us human ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Is that the truth?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Anything.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Because ... I have to relax.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Thank you.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
They were for me.  They're mine.
Lost.
What?
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
That man that shot you died in prison.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
You don't know what he thinks.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
He won't neither. He never has.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
That's possible.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yes sir.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Don't get hurt.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
Big talk.
Just keep it up.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
...Me?
With what?
With anything?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
That's twenty-six dollars.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
Okay.
You want to change rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I been immobile.
...What do you do?
Yes.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Are you in the service?
How is she?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
I know that...
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Need something else?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
"Thirty-two?"
I'd rather not...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Umm... yes. Back home.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
What?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
I gotta go.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Yes, she is.
Of course.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
How did you know?
Like Rome?
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
No, almost never.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
...this is your sweater, right?
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
No, that should be more than --
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
It's not here. Let's go.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
I hope you're right...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
It just didn't fit her profile...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Uh-huh.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
What do we do now, Everett?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
Them straw polls is ugly.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
The preacher said it absolved us.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Come back here, kid!
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I never said any of that!
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I want to fly jets, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
It's important, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
I know.
Pardon?
No, sir.
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Sid, there's no baby.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
And you turned him down??
Yeah? Why're you here?
You're better than candy.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'm looking for Sid.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I bet you do!
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Do you know that for sure?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Remember that.
One.  Squeeze.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
We're leaving.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Well, I know that now.
Fuck him.
Don't.
What's going on?!
That room!
Feel okay?
Chills?
"What we want is in that room."
"Get the fuck out of my house."
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
Huh uh.
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Yeah, I do.
My Mom's at that.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Late summer.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Very well, proceed, sir.
Prisoner exchange.
Perhaps.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Father?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Cheraw Falls.
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Name five hundred.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'm sorry.
We saw.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Father?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Well...I guess not.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Honey, Church will be fine.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
What's up, sugar?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
You need a glass?
Allman Brothers.
Nice.
I can hardly read these.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Going to tell Ellie?
I don't know.
Yes, but--
What do you mean?
This was their burying ground, Louis.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
What are those for?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The movers--
My God!
She's finally asleep.
I just said--
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
She.  Goes.  Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
There's ... another exit?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Man overboard!
I can't breathe.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Somewhat.
I can get you out of here.
Not without my effects.
That's not true.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Do you have any idea where you're going?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
I think he's telling the truth.
A moment.
Please.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What did you use?
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Why are there two ottomans?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Poppy, please --
Did you feel that?
That might work.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You're afraid of him.
Yes?
Like Crazy Glue?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
You don't know?
We don't have time for hysterics.
Why?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
God, what a fight that was.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
That's impossible.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Certainly. Right over there.
What do you want?
I suppose you're going to print them?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Your place?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Do you like them?
You wear them of course, silly.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
I poisoned him.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
What is this person doing here?
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Yeah?
Yeah - go on.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Well, when are you quitting?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
My play.
Sure.
Oh no, sir!
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
The boss is getting hoarse.
You what?
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Been where?
Right.
Who was that?
Traps shut!
I suppose you know why I came—?
I don't eat waffles.
Okay - you remember Joe—
I'm sorry nobody could come.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
What?
What?
How was your day?
Oh, George ...
Sure you are.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
What?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
What'll it be?
Okay, that's IT!!!
Thank you very much.
What?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Lemme see that.
You know him?
He won't notice anyway.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
You have no right to do this.
They're happy like this.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
You're reading?
You got the admissions letter.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
They just grow like that?
Real rain?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
I want a word with you ...
I had nothing to do with that.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Why?
... What's that?
Hi.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
And what was this?
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
...please, I just don't want it....
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Why?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I don't know.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Yeah I can't.
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Hello, this is Back.
Hi. This is Jack.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
Really?
It doesn't matter.
I'm fine. Who is this?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
You're going to work now?
Can I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Yeah.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Oh My God.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
About six months.
Yeah.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yeah.
....yeah....
Did you pick it up from the street?
Oh that's great.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
This is Barry.
I'll see you later.
What do you mean?
Lena?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
About six months ago. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.
Do you wanna have sex?
I forgot about that.
Are you ok?
No.
You're hand is bleeding.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why? ...what?
I didn't do it.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Hello, how are you?
And your name?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
Can we agree that that is that?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How you doin' Barry?
Yeah.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
What happened?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Wait a minute --
What do you have in the house?
You have an ATM?
Yes I am.
I know.
I know.
Don't puss out.
When can you leave?
As soon as you want.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Put him through.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
He's a writer, not a madman.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
It's not even noon --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
You're a sentimental man.
Well?
He'll do no such thing.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Yes?
Quite.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Did I frighten you?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
Oh, but I am!
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
You've come to lecture me?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
I did my best but, well, you know me
Sure
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
How much?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Then you explain it to me?!
You will not walk out on me
Yes?
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Sir? 
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
I wanna see the picture today
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Please don't say this.
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
They don't have to.
I want you back
Hey, kid. Gregg.
So they're Jews. . .
What does this have to do with--?
You gonna watch?
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
How 'bout a real drink?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
What?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Go 'head.
Do you see her yet?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
You want us to wait for you?
Say what you're gonna say.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
What do you mean, "you"?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
At night?
Three more, I figure.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
What?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I say?
I never noticed his face.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
With Salvy, eh?
Why don't you just call him up?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Ever get an answer?
You think he's getting out of here?
Did you ever own a saw?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Where'd they take Lisa?
Jefferies.
Wrong day?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
With that cast on -- you don't.
Read some good books.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Her father loading up the shotgun?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
He and his wife splitting up?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
What?
Would four of them -- ?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Ten here.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
How can you tell that -- from here?
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
What do you think?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What about it?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Well?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Phone number?
Steady Marlon!
What you say your name was?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You still want to go home, Moose?
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Yeah!
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Go ahead.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Have some cigars.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
Are you really going to meet them?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
We'll take it!
Man, you're schizoid!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
No.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
You promised to give it back.
Why?
What?
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
What's that got to do with it?
No.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
And your folks didn't understand?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Dig the square wardrobe!
No--I was just--maybe--
Neither can I.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
You can't talk underwater!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What?
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Good evening.
Is this him!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
You promised me!
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
One more. Smile. One more.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Where the hell are you going?
Ashley, Jesus --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Nick, I love you --
You're not hearing me here --
You told him about Nick's letters.
...maybe I die for Nick...
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Get your own room, Ashley.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
You... you... YOU --
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
I had better sex in prison.
Bam Bam.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Five million?
So what the hell good are you...
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
...never... tried...
Got something to say to me, Nick?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
What's the code?
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
I'm no threat without a gun.
You gotta be kidding me.
Where the HELL did he go?
...so where is he?
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Cancer-sucker.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
You knew there were guns in here!
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Three days, man.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
I'm just saying.
I'm just talking.
Alamo...
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
...for Christmas...
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Fine, now.
You fuckin' wish.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Seymour Scagnetti.
Daddy, did ya see that?
What? Nobody set anybody up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Give me this fucking thing.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
I'm cool.
Want a smoke?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
I got 'em, all right?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
This must have been in the family a long time.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
What's the matter with her?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I suppose it is.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Will she be dark or fair?
He knows his alphabet.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I can't --
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
How'd you happen to miss?
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Go on, hit me.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Kind of sore.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
I can't take her with me.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
We got to get movin'.
We got company. Female company.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
And that's tough, isn't it?
Would they be good to eat?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
I think he wants me.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Where the hell are we?
That we should take our friendship a little further?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Listen to me I --
It's the sequel.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
I'm sorry.
Aww, the little bird died.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Here you go, Professor.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Professor!
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Hello Dwight.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Thanks, handyman.
Yours, or the turkeys?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Father.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Did you hear?
Here we go again.
MURDERED?!!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Chip, honey?
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Hi, Hank.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Chip, your ride is here.
We can be real quiet...
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
I certainly was not!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
He killed people, Mom.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
What is it, Betty?
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I don't like this.
Yes, I understand.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
I can't understand it at all.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
"The Dante?"
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
A job?
The people at the restaurant?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Could you find him?
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I don't know.
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What a peculiar question.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
I'd forgotten.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
Unless what?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
But he also wrote --
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
No, not really.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
You had sex with you therapist?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
And they just answer them?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I know.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Sometimes. Afterward.
About me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I can't.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But that was part of it?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Why not?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Loud.
I want out of this marriage.
What do you mean?
Yeah, so?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
No, I haven't.
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why, so you can go after him?
What?
I have a pretty good idea.
Let me talk to him first.
And what?
I just thought it might --
Why not?
Well, what, then?
Cynthia!
He wouldn't do that.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
I was just trying to --
I just want to know why you're here.
About what?
You just want to ask me questions?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Okay.
I've got to get back to the office.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Afraid of getting caught?
You're intrigued?
Hello.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
What's so stupid about it?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Hung up.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
No.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
I know. Will you please leave now?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
No.
Yeah.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Medical clinic?
Kiss, kiss?
But where are you going?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
We live in 703.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
No? How come?
Fools!
About Brad's family?
I got it!  I got it!!!
Introduce yourselves.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
He was a President.
That's us.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
But they only think they're happy.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
CRIMINAL
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
She walks in beauty...
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
I can explain.
Anything I'd know?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
That's what you do with every one.
Are you chewing gum?
Yeah. Tight.
You know that chick?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Nice, huh?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Well, she is cute.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
What?
Nice shot.
Been checking your messages?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
You have to tell me --
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Huh. Let me think.
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
I finished it.
Are you all right?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
How long have you been into wine?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
That was fun last night.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Oops. Sorry.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
What's the matter?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
This one?
This one?
Does it hurt?
Five. The five longest.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Do you think it's a possibility?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Have they said anything about our area?
Sounds like a virus.
Okay.  So he was tall?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Goodbye?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
You must have known that before you came.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
No, Leavenworth.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
It's a town...
He is that.
You haven't got any money.
Who?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
Who is he?
I'm done talking. Get out.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
Why him?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
What is it you want from me?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Why'd you go into business with him?
What is it that I can't figure?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
I'm glad we talked.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
I'll send you her resume.
What about it?
You really think so?
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Excuse me?  Start?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Not if I don't let her.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Of course.
What I do to Simone?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Who are you really?
How about the nudity?
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
I don't know anything about computers.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Can't you stop that?
How?
One thing bothered me.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
No, that was me.
Do I know you?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
It's a yacht.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Don't you?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Taller, Viktor.
But that's Simone's part.
Hi.
--My God.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Don't step in the horse manure.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
You mean aneurysm.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Yes.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.
I wish I were somewhere else.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What?
Communicate?
They did?
Dead people?
...I don't know.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Superstition.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Aha. The Lovers.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
"And a slash-slash there --"
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
This is his room... isn't it?
Throw me one.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
How does it feel, Keith?
Yeah?
So?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
You're... limping.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Mac... let's get out of here.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like your guitar break.
Bill, we need to talk!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
No. What…?
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Praise Jesus.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
You have a great profile.
Where you from?
Guess what?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
See ya, Kate.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
How do you know?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
No what?
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
I hate to say I told you so.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Bandit?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Yes, ma'am.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
He's giving them up?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
And threw us into the lake.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
I've got concerns.
...About what?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
D'you talk to'm?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
...I'm sorry...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
Shoot.
A million flat.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Yes.
Where's Sartorius?
Shut up.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
No.
Get out --
What plan?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Into what?
I'll go with you.
We're taking a flight?
You didn't look very happy.
You want to fuck her?
You still don't believe in God?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What happened to us, exactly?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
What's wrong.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
No.
I can't stay here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
I think they help.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Gibarian was under enormous --
You want it coming back with us?
You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Can we go then?
You live in Manhattan?
Put it on my account, please.
I'll come with you.
Could be, I guess.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
What about Neil?
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I don't know you...
You told her?
Where?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
Why?
What did she say the down payment was?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Why?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Mike, take it easy...
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What did you do tonight?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I just sat and listened.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
... Hard?
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
You should'a brought the girl.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
What, want a glass?
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Flash, drop it--
Jesus Christ.
Lemme down, bugface!
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Would you cool it already?
How about tomorrow?
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Thanks, I already ate.
He knew.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Sit down and stop being such a child.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
In this barracks?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
What some brandy?
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
105-353.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Let me go!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You'll fix me up!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
I'll open mine now.
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Anything else?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Yes, sir.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
You heard that, Sefton?
Right.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
This is me in Cincinnati.
That is my wife.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
We're within range, sir.
All of us.
Why would you want to leave?
Well, may we have a look around?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Captain, are you all right?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Doctor Soran?
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
What did you see, Chekov?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Short range scan.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
None that I can detect, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Saavik... Is... David with you?
The Genesis planet is gone.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Close... There --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
But, why?
Give me your hand and we both live.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What you ask is difficult.
What about Spock?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Share this with no one.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
You amaze me, Commander.
That's all you have to say?
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Khan could be down there!
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
You did this -- in a day?!
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
So are we, it looks like.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
But the child --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
How soon --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
They won't --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
What's she doing here?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
... the good of the few...
Spock...!
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
You earned it.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
How?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I can't get power, sir!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
He's very human.
The question is irrelevant.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
It'll come back to him.
Oh, joy.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Status report, Admiral!
"Neutralized?" How?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
I buy that. What about him?
Implicitly.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
I meant --
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Ready sir.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Any luck...?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
I am well, Admiral.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
They are my friends.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
Really.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
I told you, there's no --
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
ATR setting...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Great name. French?
The invasion plans.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Cochrane?
Captain...?
Report.
Captain?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Right.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
We've lost Bridge control!
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I remember it made me sick.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
Barely.
They'll make it look like an accident...
He's a DOCTOR!
Spoken by you?
Well, I -
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Do we report this, sir?
This is incredible -
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
According to my information, today.
Me?
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Her own father...?
A lie?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
I think  not.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Do you know who I am?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
No. I must deactivate you.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
So... To happy endings.
Good work. The download?
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
What is our approximate distance?
Why is it moving?
Do you have a moment, sir?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we're being hailed.

I won't do it.
No!
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
What happened?
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I won't defend my life to you.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Not so long.
That's your life... not mine.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
What about Picard?
This is a mistake.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
No -- this is wasting time.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
Praetor...
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
I don't like it, George...
Hello George.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
No gas.
Gas good?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
No gas.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
A drink.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
A baby is a new person?
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
The driver will...
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I will go. But not you.
You promised.
You are cold.
Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Yes, they are.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Doesn't make sense.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Bullshit!
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Forget it's there.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Can't do it.
What's going on?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
What kind of things exactly?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Is he dead?
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
You just did.
Jesus!
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Naawww.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
About what?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
No, you're just trying to get off.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
No it doesn't.
How's Zander?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Well, look at the plus side.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Mace... you're a girl.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You're thinking...?
Agent Mackelway.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
What?
You have the body?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
I think I talked to him.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
The man knew how to dress.
They're all criminals?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
"Gone live?"
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Huh?
There are Agency regulations about this.
Jesus.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
So you went underground?
I don't carry it with me.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Who told you about her?
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Lead the way, Murman.
But why attack an Agent?
350 miles.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
You have to put things in perspective.
Don't do it, Mike.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
They're out of Glenlivet.
Listen. I had a great time.
I would love to see you again sometime.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...Which one...?
Good.  I think about things.
I heard you might be moving back...
So what's the difference?
Right.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I don't talk about her that much.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
What's the point?
They turned you down?
You miss the pain?
What's he do?
Who threw this party, anyway?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
What?
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Vegas, baby!
Whu?
They're all skanks.
She smiled baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Nice, baby.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Yeah, a good friend.
That was different.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
Yeah. You met him once.
...the Copa, in New York...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
Because he's a bitch.
They're a finesse team...
That was pretty cold, dude.
...double diamond...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
What's the matter, Carlo?
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Outside.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
And with prison record.
When did he call?
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
For bravery.
And this?
I'm going to finish school.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Don Tommassino.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Mike!
Was there a definite proposal?
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
What about McCluskey?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
Al Capone!
Michael...
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
And what do you want for Christmas?
I can't...
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Don't ask me.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
What is it?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
You just woke up!
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Well, we ate everything without you.
Marge, you like everybody.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I met him in New York.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
Could we sail to Venice?
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I know. I write like a child.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Shoes too?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Marge-maintenance.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
So I'm learning.
Oh my God. Tom.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Dickie did it.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Why? When?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Where's Dickie's father?
This is spectacular.
Excuse me?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Which is?
How did you know that?
I know.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Just kidding. Are you alone?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ten thirty?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
What rumour?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Not guilty.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Why lie?
Postmortem?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
31 people.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
That's an expensive gun.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Why?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
The moon?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
What are you doing?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
No, why?
What taxi driver?
You sure he's not Italian?
He's Black, OK?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
With the other hand, right?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
You carry a piece? You need one?
What's your name?
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
He looks like a killer.
What should I do? Call the cops?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
So whatja do now?
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Twenty-six.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I'm no cop.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Like do anything, you know.
Neither do I, I guess.
I'm a field agent.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew?  All this time?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
Do you... remember me?
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Were we going to get married?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Yes?
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
That's where you live.
What's wrong?
You should watch what you say.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
So, it is a blacklist.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
That was beautiful.
Sit.  Play with me.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Tim, I have to tell you something.
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a lovely garden.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
How'd you happen to come here?
And what had you done?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Is anyone there?
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Don't you like us?
I don't know yet.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
It's Alice, ain't it?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Thank you.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Yes, very.
In a bird shop.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
That's a chance we have to take.
Oh, my God, look at her!
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Not by the thousands.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes.
I understand completely, sir.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Some of them are.
I don't know you.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
What's that?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
You like me, huh?
Can't see a thing.
You are, aren't you?
What?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Yes, but...
You were lying.
I wrote the letter.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Why?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
You have a job?
No, I have my things in the car.
Some cream?
After the gulls attacked.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
I haven't finished my drink.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
You have his promise, then?
You must leave this house.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
You see, it is completely out of the question.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
What do you mean, Fettes?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
This is not a woman!
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Toddy hates me.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I take no gifts from you.
Get out of here!
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Only Brother.
Any attacks of pain since?
But can anything be done for her?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
I hate that picture.
Where are they? Last chance.
What did they give you?
I was a friend of your sister's.
I told you, I knew your sister.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
... it connects you to me...
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
An accident, Nathan.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Are you ok?
What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
What do you mean, dear?
Tell me what?
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
I can judge only by what I see.
How do you know?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
May I see you for a minute?
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
How long will that take?
I don't like horror comics.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
They're gaining on us!
Good.
Two down and two to go.
Maximum body-count.
Leave him alone.
You can't kill me, Star.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Michael!...
Oh, no.  Now what?
But, Mom...
You're cute, Max.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Does it burn?
But you passed the test!
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Let's go see them.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What??
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What about Mom?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Who are you calling?
Maybe dinner.
So what's our problem?
Anybody sick?
I don't know who to trust.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
You catch anything he was saying?
MacReady!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Spaceship of some kind.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
MacReady...?
What do you do on the towers?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Sir... have you a name?
You know of them?
We need your help.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes...
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
No, we created the Morlocks.
As slaves.
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
What?
That was a foolish thing to do.
May I help you?
Got here as soon as I could.
My God...
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
You can see so many here.
Good night, then.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Or mud carriers.
Alexander...?
Someone you loved very much.
It's undamaged?
It was different then.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
I see.
What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Why?
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
That's too bad.
You sure you know where to find one?
Who are you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
My father used to talk about you.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
This is really happening, isn't it?
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
What?
Do you really believe me?
How long do we have?
I might not be able to.
What? What are you thinking?
Where are we going?
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
How'd he get it?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
This is a great song.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
What.
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
On what?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Who do you think did it?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
How are things goin' out there?
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
I have no problem with that.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
What for?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
What the fuck is going on?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Louise.  Where are we going?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Call him?
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
What happened to your hair?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Louise?  Where are we?
Now what what?
Yeah.
You mean now or before?
What little dogs?
Thelma!
What?
Thelma, that is not an option.
Eeuww.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
What?
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
We're fine!  How are you?
What?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
So you admit it?
Gay? He said you were gay?
He implied it.
Nah.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Mary's a babe!
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Pipes? What are you talking about?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Who?
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Are you... an architect?
What's that?
I beg your pardon?
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That sounds like fun.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
You're a movie buff?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Uh-huh.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
You want her dead, don't you?
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Among others.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
What do you mean?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Thanks for picking me up.
How do you guarantee that?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
What's he like?
What's a mook?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
What's up, Doc?
You don't think they're too big?
Oh yeah. Fine.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Ted, are you okay?
You look great.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Ted...?
You got what stuck?
Oh God.
See you, Warren.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Oh, still sore about this.
The sun came up today.
How long until the army is ready?
Secretary of Defense...
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Hey. Nice tie.
Mr. Clear Moon.
A murder. On the reservation.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Jesus...
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
What's he smoke in that?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What do you mean?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray...
How the hell do you know?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
You saw a MiG 21?
It's what?
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
There you go with those moves again.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Lieutenant...
What about the plane?
Used to what?
No!
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You ever think about killing another human being?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
Where?
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
I'm fine.
That's what you get flight pay for.
I sit. I think. I play games.
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
One more.
I was, later.
I hope you find him.
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes sir.
Can't shake him.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
This is crazy!
Okay, okay.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Gotta go, man.
You go. I'm staying with it.
The plane is fine.
Why do you all have such funny names?
I've lost him -- where is he?
Great move. Great
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Come on, we're next.
What?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
That's Kazanski.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
ON THE NOSE?
I've seen this before.
So have I.
You didn't help.
Morning, Coogan.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
I can take care of myself.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
My wife's house.
I don't know...
I know.
Over there man.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Who are you?
How'd you find me?
Fuck you.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
No, sir.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
So, been married long?
Amazing.  Where are we?
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Shit!
Oh, Rekall.
I don't know.  Maybe.
You went to Rekall, remember?
I want that fucker dead.
Is that better?
...You mean it?
Yeah, sweetheart?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Doug...Bob McClane.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
All right.
I'm not interested in that.
Why would I lie to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
He's lying.
The reactor.
What reactor?!
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
So...now what?
Howdy, Rhonda.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
So long, cactus!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh, Jesus!!
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
What the hell are they?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
You go north, I'll go south.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
How's she doing?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Down, honey, down.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Well, what's wrong with it?
You sure this is where it was?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Ready?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
It most certainly is.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
I can describe it.
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had a description of the suspect.
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Of course.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
...What do you mean?
But what?
-- Eddie...
Let's get a cab.
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Figures.
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
No. You tell me, Shu.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
Oh come on, Cecil.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Y-yes, sir.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
That's right.
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
You getting this?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
A woman.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
I am going over here.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Teresa Banks.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
And no one found the ring?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
He probably wanted to drive over.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Oh god, Laura.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
You want a muffin?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
What'll it be?
You got it.
Nice night.
I did? I didn't see anything.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I already made you two tapes.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
I am The Muffin.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
What about tonight?
You want to see...
No.
Sex?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Fine.
Dad...
Who was that?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Four cases in three years...
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
Gruber...
What does it mean?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Orthopedics?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
And what did your team do...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I didn't do too well for you.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
...and you're going to do that?
Her doctors killed her.
The most respected...
Thank you...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Listen to me, fella...
Still looking.
Really. How wonderful for you.
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Who told you that?
You, you don't under...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Pardon?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Then why don't you testify?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
Yes. Yes, I have.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Been a long time, huh...?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I just saw her.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
So is the town, I notice!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
The nightmares.
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Can I read it?
Come on.  Kids love horror.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Your bed?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
When do you think it'll be done?
You're not crazy, by the way.
Freddy, for all I know.
You got it.  What's happening?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Yes?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Me?  Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Coffee'd be nice.
He knows.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Well, that's all part of it.
Carry on.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Ninety-six.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Why then.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
What the hell is going on?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Yes, sir.
They have every right Chuck.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Suicidal...
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
I'm sorry...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Yes.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Get out.
No.
What's that?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
When did you talk to Lula?
She really say she was pregnant?
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
...are followin' him around.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
That don't smell like a More.
They sure do stink.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
You think he saw us?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Oh shit...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Yeah, I'm here.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Oh God, Sailor.
Uh-huh?
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
LULA!!!!
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
That's not why I called.
Santos... It isn't.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Simple? Kill him? How?
No.
In the head.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Someone's gonna see us.
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
No.
I didn't see nothin'...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
So I hear.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
What's this guy's problem?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
So sensitive.
The hood jumper?
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Me? What can I do?
I'll be... somewhere else.
You driving this car?
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
Vernon.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
I'll miss my bus.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Can I ask you something about her?
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Maybe she didn't come here.
I just wanted a little sip.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Jealous? Of me?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I think so... What about you?
I thank you.
Do?
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Jesus.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
New?
Is that Cristaile?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
He told you.
And what did you say?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Hardapple?
Cherry.
It was a beautiful present.
Aren't you glad?
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
I'd love to hear it.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Hiya, Walter.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I was asleep.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I could take you downtown.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I'm twelve.
Do you have many friends?
It's getting dark. Go home.
I said the job is okay.
What?
Honest? No.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
You have no feelings for your niece?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Is this the first one?
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
You're very late.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
Close your eyes.
What?
To relax.
Not so fast.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
And what are you doing?
A nap?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
It was a small house.
Is that a school?
K through sixth.
Look, you can go now.
Sounds like a special guy.
They seduce you?
What?
Neither am I.
I've got problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I say we call it quits.
What's this?
Do you want to talk about it?
She-hit.
Wasn't up to me.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
Fine.  Be that way.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Jesus, Lindsey--
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
I think it likes you.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
How?
I don't know how!
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
What's the matter with you?
He's convulsing!
You better not say you missed that.
Hippy, you pussy.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
He can still make it.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
And how long will you be away?
Used to what?
What is that one over there called?
How should I be ... arrogant?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Claudia, let's get married?
Why?
I love you.
But where did you finally end up?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Who are you talking to?
But for what reason should I come there?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
Ettore...
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Don't you ever paint men?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Anything new develop?
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
You know, I don't love anybody.
You're kidding!
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
No.
Yes.
One of the other Sisters?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Why?
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
No.
What do you mean?
No I don't.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Uh huh.
Do you think he loves you?
And what did you do?
What baby?
I... I don't understand.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like to be?
I've stopped menstruating
What else did she tell you?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
She watches... she listens.
Oh, yes.
Alright.
I really love you.
Did you want it to come out?
May I open my eyes now?
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Who?
Yes.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Is someone in the room with you?
Him.
How did she know about him?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
No!
It's your favourite...
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
None as far as I know.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
I am not with the Inquisition.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I'm only interested...
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
There's nothing here.
Was the child full term?
The sheets...
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Her spiritual health.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
May I be present?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Are you now?
You don't think...
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
But I won't.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Oh, there you are!
Is he?
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
Well, what happened?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
I see.  Do you like the play?
The big hammer?
But that's not like a real person at all.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Is she?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And what do you do about it?
Parading?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Lip reading.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
That'll keep you busy.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
How d'you reckon that one out?
I hope he fell off.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Like what?
Let's go and muck in.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
You are.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
You're a window rattler, son.
He's betrayed the class.
Y'what?
Look after him.
But...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
Can you get it a little closer?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Just machinery.
You want to try?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
<u>He</u> died.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
It's over, Hunter.
What do you mean?
Yes?
The flamethrower!
That must have been when he got it.
Recognizable!  In that?
Is it armed?
What's the frequency?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Yeah?
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Let's hear it.
What the hell happened?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
It was time for that a couple days ago.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Is it dead?
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
How many of them are there?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
When?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Listen to what?
Hold it, hold it...
What's wrong?
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
What's the problem?
Compensate!
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
So, what do you think?
You should hit the sack, too.
'Bout five minutes.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
You're more than modest.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
You sat and talked until it was light...
I never intended you to be.
Champion to champion.
What have you got to do with it?
A dull cliche.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Then say so.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Feeling better, my dear?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
We have that in common.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
She did...?
Okay.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Happy little housewife...
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
Okay. Mix.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Don't calm down.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
It's obvious you're not a woman.
What would you like? Texas?
You know what I'm going to be?
With the paper to prove it.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
But she just got here...
Behind in your dues? How much?
Hmm?
No.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Subway.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
If I only knew how...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Karen.
Of course.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
May I have your coat?
I'm not crying.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Addison wants me to play it.
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Right here.
If you'd like.
I'd like to hear it.
She's just outside the door.
How far to the station?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
I remember.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
That was a pity...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
With gestures, of course.
What's so funny?
That was way back...
How about calling it a night?
Don't be evasive.
That's beside the point.
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Call, what call?
"Liebestraum."
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
That was fun.  What now?
Goddamnit--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
Were you eyebrow reading?
Who's first?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
When?
Did he just say what I think he said?
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
Who?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--Jesus--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Speak.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
What do you want to know?
Same kind of crap--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
They are not my clients.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Haldeman too?
How grand?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Howard Hunt here.
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Where?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
It may never come out.
But it's possible.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
I did all right on McCord.
Anyone but Bernstein.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
What else have you got?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
I'll do it.
What did you just say?
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
All right, I got some scotch.
What do you suppose they're saying?
Me too.  For the most part.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Because I want to.
You talked to Stifler?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
What's that?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
What?  We both have cars.
That's not why we're going out.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
You're so big!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
What the heck is this?
Okay.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Dad!!
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Okay, I get it.
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
You've got something going?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Move with the music.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Yeah Vick?
I want to hear you say it.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
What?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Then she said -- she loves me.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
The key is don't look down.
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
What?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Oh God. Shit...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Claude...?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Nothing's happening!
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
How to read.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Who did you hear it from?
Come out! I can do alterations.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
By pulling my hair?!
I'm going to stretch my legs
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
It's the best fork of all
Sad?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Anya, wait!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
What?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Rasputin!
You are the boy ...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
You don't want my autograph.
Who's on television?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
It's an important issue.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Oh!
Alvy, I...
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
You-you play... very well.
Right!  Where?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
And we'll digest our food better.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
M'hm.
Look, look at that guy.
M'hm.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Don't you think I do?
Of course.
How is it any different?
Yes, it is.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Uh-uh-why?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Were you always funny?
You followed me. I can't believe it!
You followed me!
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
It's his name.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
David! David! I can't believe this!
What's- It's me, open up.
What?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Remember, we had that thing.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Yeah.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Are you?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
You wanna lie down?
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
And... uh-
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Yeah.
Did you know the contractor?
It's the way they do things.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
It's not a contest.
Anymore.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
When does he graduate high school?
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Oh yeah?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Not as a rule.
It was fifteen seconds.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
Take your time, Jer.
I mean, you're really back.
Truce?
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Otis!!!!
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
That is not true.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
This is insanity.  Sally...
I don't want to go tonight.
Okay.
Me too.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes I did.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Hm.
What?
I need to leave you now.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Medallions.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh?
Really??
Are you asking me to marry you?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I wasn't finished.
Everyday.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Panes?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Enough about me.
Like Joe.
She's such a great photographer.
I thought it was okay where it was.
A notch above the storage room.
I trust you.
Well good.  Thank God.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Not nice.  Not kind.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Invisible!
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Quiet -- sshhh!!
I order you to find out where we are!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Worker!  Come back here now!
Well...no, but --
Come on, Z.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
...I should?
Ask me why we're so successful.
What do you see out there?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Yeah, I know.
Something the matter?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Eight-thirty.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I'm not very good at it.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Too slow?
Was he really upset when you told him?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
You sure you want to throw that card?
I just want some fresh air.
I don't want to talk to him.
Are you all right?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
I see you bought some napkins.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
I mean, after that?
How's everything at the apartment?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
I know how it is.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Don't mind what?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Hi, Baxter.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Good evening, Baxter.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Kubelik.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Yes, I know.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I missed you, Fran.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Where do you live?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Winning the war by yourself.
Let's talk about you.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
Cook school -- that did it.
That's a light down there --
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Yeah, I know.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
I --
Signs?
I never heard about that.
They nail him for it bad ?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Ours.
Touchy.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate ?
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Yeah.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
A lame ?
But why ?
Thank you, sir.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Change.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
I got bored in Saigon.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
I'm Kurtz.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Gimme water.
Fuck no.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Both of us...
Were you with him, when...
He'll kill us.
Are you finished surfing?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
What?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
I should be checking on the boat.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
What?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
What's going on?
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Ben Corbett?
Desmond.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Does he have people?
A daughter in Oregon.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
You know Meyerling?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Don't push me..!
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Shut up!
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Why the smirk?
Get the fuck out of here.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Carol the waitress?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Getting loud, getting loud.
Thank you.
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Hi.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
This one has a special meaning.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
That seems like a good choice.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
I had to see you...
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Was this supposed to be your room?
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
How to die, mostly.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Hey -- you called me... I...
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Which color was that?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Go away.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Oh, my gosh.
I told you to go on in.
Because...  ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
So you're from around here?
What is this?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
I ain't scared of you.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Deadline?
You think this is a fucking joke?
A player?
Twenty large?  That's all?
Now what?
You want me to pump?
Nikita?
You're one of them, aren't you?
An assassin?
What does that mean?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Just Electra?
With computers.
How did you get into the business?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
After that?
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
But he won't shoot you right then?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
Yes.
What did he want?
Was that it?
Do you have ulcers?
What?
No.
No?
Are you attracted to me?
Why?
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
She was taken.
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
I thought it was interesting --
Do you believe that?
It's possible.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
You guys having a go a me or what?
Who's your friend?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Like Custer huh?
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Close!
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
You capitalist pig!
I don't want to ruin your day.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Damn!
So?
What do you want me to do?
Some deal you did there!
That's my mum's.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Turned Czech huh?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
What?
It's just talk, he's drunk.
What? You are crazy!
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Can we charge admission?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
We don't need you.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
Shall I wash these out?
Hmm, I still owe him.
What is it you want?
No problem, is it at your place?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
So, he didn't fire you?
Just yesterday.
Josh!
You are responsible...What has happened?
Have you lost all control of this city?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
And I have no idea why.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
It could help with a new car --
That's over. Way over.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Were you with Jamie?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Hypotheticals --
You do --
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Were?
'Is it really me?'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- This play means a lot to me.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
I'll get something for us to drink --
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
The play's going to be really good.
Your turn.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
Excuse me?
You're sometimes not sure?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Are you trying to seduce me?
Ergo?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
No.
Help me live until I die?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
By accident --
No.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Like what, sir?
I thought she built it herself.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Thank you.
So what did we just make?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
This... is the number one single?
Yes, sir!
Uh, yes, sir...
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Oh yeah.
No, Chinese food is fine.
Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Then where the hell is he?
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
A mall?
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
You didn't?
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Dick? Dick who?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
Yeah, I guess.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
You ever held another job before?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
What'd you come out here for?
Hi.
What for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
You love him?
Yeah. I can imagine.
Holly.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
He'll say that?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Don't call me stupid.
How bad off is he?
What'd you put him in there for?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Don't.
Positive?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Yeah.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Maybe.
Hi.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Where're you goin'?
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Go away.  Let me rot?
Was she pretty?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Never.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Pick those up, Reno.
Pictures don't lie.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
If you could, I'd –
Hello, Barton.
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
I write.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
He's a great writer –
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Charlie. How are you.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...Yeah, okay.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
How did you know about that?
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Well...
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
You gotta believe me –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Yeah, but Charlie –
I'm at the Earle.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Excuse me?
L.A.P.D.
Physician, heal thyself.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
It's been three months.
How about the coke?
Who?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
How long were you dating him?
Do you have a cigarette?
What's your new book about?
Sure.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
She wiped out her whole family.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I like you.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Why take the risk?
I don't know.
I found Lisa Henderson.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No thanks.
I finished my book.
How did it end?
I hate rugrats.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I never heard of him.
What's goin' down, son?
What is it you got between you?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
So what do we do -- nothing?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
You sure?
Who are you?
Did you check all four years?
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Let's get out of here.
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Do you still love her?
These are great.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Decipher?
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
She's good.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
I'm your family.
What's that about?
It's three thousand dollars!
I really... admire you.
Would you check out my studio some time?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
Wanna Mac?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
A what?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
You're not the Mayor.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
And the truth frightened her?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
It does to me.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
I don't.  So, no.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I'm on break from-
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Mr. Freeze.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
No!?
That's gotta hurt.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Impressive
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You will rescue my wife
I find that unlikely.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
He ran away?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
What now sir?
Up here, Al.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
So glad you could come.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
Like normal folks.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
Who is it?
How could I forget?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
I got family. ...Please.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
I know. I called them.
How much do you weigh?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Thank you, Vicki.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
What is it you want?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
All street mimes should be executed.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
My brother's a priest, man.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
How'd you know it was me?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Right first time.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
I beg your pardon?
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Well, there is that ...
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
My butt's bothering me!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Huh? Huh huh.
Uh, you first.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh... dill, um, face...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
...Two...
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
She sure does.
Cool, huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You'll be rich!
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
So can I?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Our cemetery?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Yes.
Beetle!
Your qu...?  But you're...
Otho'll know what to do.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
The attic room is locked --
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
What do you think?
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Yes. I think so, too.
Yes.
I would like to walk today.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
I hope you're comfortable.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Yes. That could be true.
Yes. I like to watch.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Can you see well?
I don't want Robert.
I agree.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I can't write.
... Sir?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... Evening, Chance.
... I see.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Yes, I will.
... In the garden?
You heard?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
No! He's a real gardener!
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
This is not what I requested.
... So what does all that add up to?
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Oh? What?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
How was it?
And he was with her.
Don't forget me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Suck my dick!
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I know.
Maxine...
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Yex?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Security.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
You're glowing again.
Lotte, this is so good...
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I'm getting divorced.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Yes?
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Darling!
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Vegas.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Yeah what?!
Well what?
You still know.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Don't pay to complain.
I don't. I have my own.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
No...no...no..
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
I don't want to know.
Leave off..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Oh, man, don't say that..
Shit.
I know my rights.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling--
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Please!  Please!
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
No, they--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Huh?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
From who?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
So Dieter has the money?
Jeffrey.
Oh?
But he's--
Increases?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Hey Walter--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
What the hell is this?
Oh shit.  Walter.
What the fuck?
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Look, man, did you--
Is the car out front yours?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Yeah?
What's mine is mine.
No Dude.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Well we--I don't--
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Oh, shit.
Bullshit. Walter!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
how long since he was bitten?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
What do you really think?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Going somewhere?
You're blind --
Hold out your hands.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you doing?!
There is no cure.
Like what?
You're hurt --
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You don't look so good.
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
This isn't human blood.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
Who are you people?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Trying to find the energy.
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Oak?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--<u>myth</u>--
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What can I get you?
--like you hurt the baby--
--hours before--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
You want a hand?
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
We should be so lucky.
English.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Boy Kurth.
--who?
What?
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Asleep--
Spite.
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
What're you nuts--
Ah, Domini?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Elly Kedward?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Why?
....Ma'am?
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Abby. What's the matter?
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...Who?
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
I didn't say that.  Well?
I want you to go fishing.
...What?
Yeah...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Pour that back.
What.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Hello, daddy.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
Do you like that?
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Come in.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
Sometimes I think I do.
I love you Don with all my heart.
You. what?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Shh. I'll tell you.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Hey? . You like to walk.
How is Central these days?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
So. what's next?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Why not?
Yeah. but.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Goodnight.
You were late.
You like mysteries that much?
You worry about me really?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
I can't dance fast.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Well. Okay.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
You happy, baby?
Should we buy it?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What?  Yeah, sure.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Excuse me?
What can I do for you guys?
No.
What the fuck is that?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Good night.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Mexico.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What do you guys want?
Why are you smiling?
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah.
I didn't mean to...
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Yes, I do.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Right on.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Stoned?
So?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Sail.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group. What's your assignment?
What's happened to you?
I don't do that kind of thing.
Can you read?
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Of course I am.
It could've happened to anyone.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
No.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.
Sex.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
No.
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What did you prescribe for her?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
What did he say?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
You didn't know about it before that?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Frank!
Oh -- Well, they're different.
It's not my taste.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
That wasn't the deal.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
I'll talk to him later.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Yes.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
I don't know.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't say that!
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Madge?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
No, really?
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Want another cigarette?
No, your kids.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Help cook?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
You drink bug repellent?
What?
No. I'll do them later.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Am I interrupting anything?
I would love to come for dinner.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I'll pick you up.
How about if I set the table?
Take me somewhere.
What?
Have you ever been to that station?
Nobody's asking you to.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I bet you could do a book.
Trouble. Why?
Well, what is this?
What are you doing?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
What about your husband?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Where you going?
Want anything special for dinner?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Died there?  How?
'S up?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Where's the others?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That's some terrible shit.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
But.
Sorry, my brother.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
What the hell do you want?
I didn't sell it.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
You shouldn't have hit me.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
They were early.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
Violet, please!
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar ...
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
We're going to need some time.
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
You know he would have done you, too.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
How many'd you do?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Why?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Are they really?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I'm already in your bed.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Even though he knew about you?
For what?
What choice?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
Yes.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
How'd it go?
Oh, God.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
You're asking me a direct question?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
No.  We can't risk it.
...they won't let you go...
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...

-- sir? --
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Jesus...
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I don't know.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Okay, so you're a victim.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Where are we?
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
Who paid the bill?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
And that's it?
What was I thinking, right?
Think I could rent a scooter?
Where did this body go?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
My husband's out looking for him.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
Tell him we're busy.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What?
<u>Where am I</u>?
What if it doesn't come back?
...your ducts?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Go away.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
Sam!
Yes, thanks.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
I'm sure you have
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
Er ... no.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Bastard!!!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
No, really.
Every day?
They'll be there waiting.
Oh God! What have we done?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Don't do anything silly.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
He is dead.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
That's it.
Can I forget it?
What! Shit!
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Yes.
I'm sorry but ...
Mother? Is that you?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
This is an emergency!
Sign here please.
What is it?
Ha!!
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Are you expecting anyone?
You can trust me on this one.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He's very very sick.
At least he's got people around him.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Our Lady of Misery.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
Sleeping.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Five years.
I need to sit down a minute.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
How's he doing?
He's crazy. He can't help it.
That's ridiculous.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
I'm not hungry.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Wait.
No.  No.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Oh, God, no!
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Yes.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Why do you say that?
Sure.
Did you shoot their boots?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
So who's the guy?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Do it then.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
How long has it been since you've been home.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
It's Aaron.
Play back the last line...
Should I...
Bye, sweetie.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I like "godsend."
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
So great -- right?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
One year...almost one year.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
So he was indicted?
Billion.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Jane?
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
No.  Were you going to you?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Because you're nuts.
Hi.  It's me.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Hello?
How can you say that to me?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I got promoted for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Whaddya mean?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
See you later -
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Where where...
I mean, you look so pretty.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Just about anything, Walter.
Are you alright?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
I know.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Yeah?
I can't talk right now.
No...look I'm busy...
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Walter shut up and relax!
Well I'm overjoyed.
Are you done with these?
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Why not?
T-tell him that?
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
You didn't like them.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Invite me in, Pike.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
He doesn't look fifty.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
You broke up with my machine?
Hi there.
How are you doing?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Thanks.
For the dance.
Come again?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
That's me.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
To bring you... your birthright.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Meet me at this address after school.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Not a pressing issue.
Here?
No -- you don't have to --
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Buffy...
I...
Thank you very much.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
So very much.
Really?
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
The mark of the Coven.
Could be.
Okay, let's go.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Like you've got a grip.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You said "Crash".
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
What a nasty thing to say.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
It's possible.
Yeah...you a witch?
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Which one of us?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
It was a cocksucking call!
How come you don't like me?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Jesus.
No.
What?
Fear and ignorance.
Don't try me.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Who you calling a "boy"?
I gotta go now, Dad.
Can I give you my testimony?
He walked eighteen?!
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
What the hell's going on out there?
Who ain't?
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
...been right, but who knows?
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll call you right back.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
All right.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
That's right, yeah.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Well...
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Half of everything is mine.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can't get rid of him?
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Okay. Just take it easy.
She took care of the dealers...
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You sure?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
But as much as they loved her...
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Yeah.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
No, you don't.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
...under?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You threw it away?
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
Oscar wants you to call him.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
To the Riviera.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I should have -
Oh, sh-
Get - get up!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Not gonna let me in?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Yeah, okay.
All right, I will, I will.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
No.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You know where she gets this from!
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Yes.
You can't talk to me like...
Go get a bag, man.
And here. Here.
Here we go!
Is that what you did?
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Artie!
For what?
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Ace.
Tell me.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Thanks.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Nothin'.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
You know?
Get the fuck out of here.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
Right.
He was just on the phone.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
I think that's it.
Yeah.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
You walk past me?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Charlie M?
You're a little confused?
There's a lot of people here.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Yes, uh...
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Selina, are you okay?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Wha-at?
What's the catch?
You think so?...Selina?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Nice breasts.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Can you make him stop!
I told you I should've cuffed him.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Please.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Tell me what she looks like.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
What do you mean?
Even if you found us -- what then?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Do you have to point that?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You could've hit me.
259-7881.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
You're the man with the gun.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Five ... six.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
We don't see you.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Yeah?
How far off are you?
Who were you talking to?
Who are you?
I thought so.
You could always make it up to her.
Saw that one.
Who the fuck is he?
Fuck off back to Essex!
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
What?
What's it to you?
Yes, thank you.
Give me that look again.
What look?
What's that about?
Maybe.
Do you miss him?
Maybe.
You mean that?
Depends what it is.
Why?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Come on, Dil --
Details, baby, details.
Please, Jimmy.
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Yes.
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
You promise?
Good-bye, Dil
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Love you, Dil.
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
Thirty-five.
You know her, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Have a look at him.
Eddie and Tinker died.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Dil!
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
Thanks.
Why?
Why do you want to do that for?
Should blow you away, you know that?
And what's she like between the sheets?
Who is he?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What is it now?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Ever see hurling?
How different?
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Why?
See? I was right about you.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having two pints in the Rock.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Don't think that way.
What?
Why?
You stupid bastard --
What you say, faster?
I never know nothing.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
All right -- where's the letter?
I think that's what you ordered.
No -- I guess not.
What?
Oh, you should see your face.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Reggie -- stop!
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Thanks very much.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Agents.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Barely, yes.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Brian.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
But you're -- divorced?
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Do I knock or something?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Then who does?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
I'm not fifteen.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
What are you doing?
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
Got you.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Go on.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't know anything.
Leave me alone -- !
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
No -- in my room.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Is your husband with you?
How do you know?
Charles is.
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
I don't think I follow you.
How do you shave in there?
Be careful, Peter.
What?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
I've never seen him before.
What is it about?
Yeah? What's that?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
I get the imports.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
What happened?
Is Jody still awake?
She's still a virgin.
Really?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
You fucked me up!
You gave me a 'D'.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You're the killed.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
No! That's his table.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Did Sharon say no?
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
That's what he said.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes.
You ok?
Hide your laptop here.
Maybe it won't stay in.
That wasn't me ...
Unfair?!
No argument there.
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...moron.
He could've called first.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
I got, like, uh....
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
Would you hurry up, please?
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
...up.
It happens to this piece of shit...

We're clear.
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
You stole this truck! That's...
 
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
You're nuts, goin' back there!


Okay.
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.


 Oh...
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old...

 Oh...
 Go on.

These'll keep it cold.

I'm a dangerous man!
No!

Worth a try.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
We got two paddles.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
That is loud!  I'm 
...deal with this asshole.

They're takin' off.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Hang...
What the--?
 What's it say? 

Sorry.
They'll meet you at the top.


 Well.
Oh, oh!
 big balls.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.

But...
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.

Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You'll kill us all!
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Went away? 

...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...

...quick in and out.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
 But...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
I assume you want that to go.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...to die for a country that's...

 ...checked. 
I would've in another life.
Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Rangers.
...tight!
It's not over, Brynner.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
A man named Tim Ma-...
...back...
...without caution...
And what if it does?

...Mason?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...you answer mine.
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...seriously.
I didn't sell the boy any...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...on the other end of this phone.
Just go check the temperature.
Don't move!
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
The usual.  Doc.


I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Then these are all new owners?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Always?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
Probably.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
What for?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What is it?
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
Oh, my, yes.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Sure thing.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
That's a filthy habit.
Why?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You've done well by yourself.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
What for?
A complete surprise?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
You left your keys in the ignition.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Why?
What about it?
Just... I have to.
I know.
You saw my fa... father? When?
She's not tied up!
What does it look like?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
No...
That's good. Now what's her name?
Where can we go?
Where'd he go yesterday?
I think I got something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
You'll find one of those people.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
I said, the northwest valley.
Yes...
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Yes. No.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
How did they get it away from him?
This?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Fifty lire... 
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
But you don't have any kids!!!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Why? What do you mean?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Did you ever see her again? 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Father, I have sinned...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
You don't really think so?
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
It didn't end very well, did it?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's happened?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
Ow!
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Susan, it seems to me -
Oh, yes, sir.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Yes?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
I know you will.
Hello, Brad.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
I'll sign those papers -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
It's a letter from her lawyers.
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
I know, but -
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
I think you'd better leave now.
That's it, everybody out.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
And you said yes?
No, you're not really getting married?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
There's more, isn't there?
You don't have anything to do with it.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
He's your fiancé.
So what are you saying?
I'm just kidding.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
With this guy locked in?
Are you open?
Yeah.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
You win.
Seven months.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
FUCK!
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Design major.
Jesus.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Number six.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Let me borrow your car.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
What?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Because I'm happy.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
What responsibility?
Lovely story.
How's your eye?
Like ten after.
Are you open?
Yes.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Excuse me?
They are not.
How much can you bench?
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
She's my girlfriend.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
The porno mags?
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Bunch of savages in this town.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
You're trusting.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Something wrong?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Please calm down.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Hey! Where are you going?!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I don't want Caitlin...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
That's tight. Solid.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I hope it feels good.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
I copy.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Excuse me?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
He can handle it.
I can't believe you just said that.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Of course I do.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Gabe!
Thanks for holding on.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
I won't do it.  No way.
He'll freeze.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
Yeah...
Tucker and Walker.
I don't know about totally.
This way.
Is it set?
Appreciate it.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Been punished, yeah?
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Fine, fine.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Crime?
Do you mean Church of England?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Something like that.
Just part of hospital routine.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
What?
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
You like being a lawyer?
But not now?
Just had one.
When was the last time you took one?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
What?  What did you say?
Twenty five?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
...if they're wrong?!
I'm in town for a short time.
Try?
I got caught up at work.
What's he sayin'?
Let's not get excited, sir.
You on some kind of work plan?
Me, specifically?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
You - you killed him?
You're cool.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
You listening to me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
How about the thingy next to it?
What?
58th and Central.  You know it?
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Are you breathing?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Vincent?
I'm not catching a melody.
What difference does it make?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
It's not bullshit.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Would you have called her?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
I don't know.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
You're full of shit.
That's what you said...
That's the reason?
Slow down!
They said send you downstairs.
I was only going one way.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
What was your horse's name?
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
People do have heart attacks.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
That's it?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You're certifiable.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Surprise me.
Equitation.
Has this happened to you before?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
That was him.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
A water main broke.
Okay, I will.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Did you kill him?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
Love at first sight?
I believe you.
I'm sorry.
Without a song in my heart.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You made your decision yet?
I don't know...
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
A dog bit it.
And you have no idea where he lives?
You've asked me that one three times.
<u>Why you</u>?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
Do you believe me?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
That you come with me.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
You're --
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
I didn't realize I was out.
Hokkaido Island.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
We could be together again --
Greenbank?
It's good to see you, Ellie.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Yes.  Very much.
I don't follow.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
The final countdown.
I can't do this --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
Tell us about it.
We saw the broads.
I don't know, Boss.
You got your mind right, Luke?
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Pair'a nines.
So then you just call him.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
We got it locked in the sock.
Like I always do?
What's the writing say?
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
One, two, three... 
He'll never make it.
No. No chains either.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Now look what you did.
Fear of what...
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
We'll get the paramedics...
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Ruben.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Is that it?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
He was in my apartment!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
I was.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.
It's none of my business anymore...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
What about her arms?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
Helen Hudson...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
We were together six years, sir!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Did you come?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
That's going well, then.
And her husband? What was he?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Do you find him attractive?
Have you seen his penis?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'd like to go back. James...
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Isn't that rather too close...?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Do we have to talk about this?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Hi, Mom.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Fuck me.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
Ecru.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
You too, Mom.
I haven't had a crush since I was
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Do you?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Sounds grim.
The restaurant, too?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess so.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
I've met someone else.
I heard about your friend.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Oui.
Hello?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Good.   I'm good.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Someone else coming?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I only have your word for that.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Because you're the closest.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Man, I can get anything.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Yes.
We've got to get out of here.
No.   How much?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
The baseball is mine.
How's my brother?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Anybody know about that car outside?
The hell it is.
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
How do we know what room she's in?
You're not helping.
J&amp;B?
What are you doing?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
What's it to you?
You're already a thief.
Shut up!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
You say she killed a policeman?
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Let's end this here.
Give it back!
You shouldn't have come.
Let's stop a moment.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
What was it?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Don't you want to see her again.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
What does it say?
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Talent. Hi.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're welcome.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Do you feel okay.
In a better place.  I hope.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
I can see her.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
How the hell did you do that?
Get it?
Go away.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
I've got him if you want him.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
"Our" Crow...?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
What do you mean?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
It's not really important.
You talking to me?
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
That's repulsive.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Yes.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
What?
Yes it does.
I think that's for the best.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
What are you saying?
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
German.
Where did you say she's from?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
What are the boys like?
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
See that wasn't so bad.
That was cool.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Okay.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I don't know.
No.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
I was just kidding.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
You told her I never said I love you before?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Who is this?
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Be more specific.
Even there?
Fuck her yet?
Blow me.
Call me later.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Morning.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
To my triumph, of course.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
It's really important.
What are you talking about?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
How?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Ollie.
It's your play.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Certain wishes do.
Can't you tell me later?
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy, it's true.
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Yes, Amy?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Who are you?
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I can not tell you.
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Can't you get it, darling?
This is more fun than just pretend.
Merry Christmas.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
No, thank you.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hide me? Why?
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
How's the rest of your health?
How have you been feeling?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
George bit you?
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Get rid of him!
Why not? There's been a murder.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
So what do I do?
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I thought you and George were getting married.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I know.
I do development for TV movies.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Script coverage?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
So what book did you buy?
My mom used to get PMS too.
No, she died when I was twelve.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
No, but thanks for the warning.
Is it that funny?
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
No, it was our first date.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
Take some allergy medicine.
He was found a few blocks away.
You think mafia hit?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Police.  Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
I didnít requisition a secretary.
How can I submit this?
Why, yes.
Who is it?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
No.  I, ah...
Donít kill me!
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
What happened to you?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
What?
How much do you usually get paid?
They barely talk anymore.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
Where's the girl?
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Just what you think I mean.
This is undeclared income.
I'm not sure... I might have.
In the car.
Presence.
Gimme a quarter.
What?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well...
What?
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You have a lot of secrets.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
You really believe that?
All set.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
What?
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
This stuff really works? No shit?
What you wanna do?
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Yeah?  Like what?
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
You fucked up little prick!
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
Courtyard?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A yawp?
LOUDER!
A madman.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
All right!  What'd she say?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Where are you going?
But father, it's not fair.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Look at this.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh..
Yes.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Where are my men?
I saved your life is what I did!
You don't have to be so touchy.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Right... You have a boat.
What is it?
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
I don't know...you got what we need?
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Joey...
Nothing.
Get the boots.
John,we're going huntin'.
Who's going?
You're full of shit!
They did too!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Let's go!!!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
I do!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
That's new, isn't it?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
You are his friend.
Where is he???
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Get anything?
You know a guy named Merle?
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
You Biederman?
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What?
C'mon. I've got the car.
We... Three bullets.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
You do?
Yeah... I guess.
What else?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Watch it, shithead!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Did you go hunting.
Yeah.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
No.
Never one.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Technothugs?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Mug sheets.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Kill him... kill him.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Just great.
Need help?
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
You my partner?
But Sergeant...
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Yes.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
You should be in hospital.
They always are.
You know that you're in my house.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Why? It don't hurt.
What's that, sir?
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
But I like the new one better.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Say ... about the interest ...
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
What Grange?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
No. She's gone.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
-- in gold.
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
Not long -- now.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Yes.
We can still use my butter money.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
I'll never get my washing done.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Put it down now.
John!
Holly Gennero?
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
I still feel like shit.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Is that him?
This is --
So whatsa deal?
These seats come out?
You'll be okay.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
How are you doing?
So... that sure is something.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry...
Well...
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
They won't talk to you.
That's good then.  You've found something.
Oh no!
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
I can't talk to him.
I got Sal.
What do you want to know that for?
Okay, what do you give me?
What the hell you doin' back there?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
What else?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
Are you a lawyer?
Yeah.
You stopped?  Why?
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You mean that?
What?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
But I want to know what you think.
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
Okay, when do I get them?
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Hey, you okay?
Here's your document, Sonny.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Doing what?
Robbing a bank.
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Of course not ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
Who the hell is that?
What is it, Choco?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
What about your toe?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
<i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Yes.
That's the rumor on the street.
Is that you, Domino?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
I said stop it.
What did he say about the arm?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Fast and or furious.
How you be?
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
I hope the block is still standing.
That's it?
What makes Sammy run?
Wake up!
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
...peanuts.
Sorry, comb got caught.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
And move to Long Island...
Twenty "D" Duracells.
How many you say?
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
WAKE UP!
Sweet Dick Willie.
That's my name.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Sal, I want my money.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
I can't be staying long anyway.
Then we'll do something else.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Keep dreaming.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Sez who?
Some are OK.
I love you.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
You're it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Yeah...
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
What?
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
I don't follow.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
I go to school where I live.
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Your mom made a move on me.
She did not.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
HARRY.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I kinda screwed things up.
Me, me, me!
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You're it.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Damn! What are the odds?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Why ith dat newth?
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Well, something stinks.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
You really are a pirate.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
What?
Everything?
The evidence of what?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
I'm sorry Gurney.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Things have been so serious here lately.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Always.
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
What is it?
Where?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
I didn't feel well...
Goulash.
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
I don't know.  Where?
Um, okay... roll camera
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Wow.
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
You got the job?!!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Like <u>what</u>?!
Goddamn landlord.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
For this one, we need $60,000.
What other sixty-thousand?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Um, I guess --
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
You look beat.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Uh, atomic energy?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
I can't get it to go up.
Let's get married.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Yeah...?
You're sure this is gonna work?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
What the heck is THIS?!!
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
Al!!
I'm moving out.
You know what would be great?
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Hey, he cheated on her.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Ma...
Hi. Is Shari here?
She won't.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
You batted or you bunted?
Why do it?
I mean bad.
That's lucky.
Twenty-nine.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Okay.
No... Could you?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
Where were you?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Hi.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Check forging.
Ed... I'm sorry.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
We don't have foibles.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Here they are.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Hmm?
I don't believe you.
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Still clear?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
These are private -- these are for us.
But other people can see them too.
I don't care.
I mean at you.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yes, Paul?
What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
So you saved her.
Did you talk to Exley?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
We talked.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah, that's Stens.
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
What about him?
Bud...
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
More or less.
Where are the police academy files?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
And?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
What about you?
I need to speak to you.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
What's her name?
No.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
How was I?
Where will you go?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
None.  Call it a hunch.
A sweet man.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Where'd you hear that?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Really?  How?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
It is?
Told by whom?
Yes.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
I don't know what that--
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
Who?
<u>Here</u>?!
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Same thing?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Feeling lucky?
Well then who can?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Neil, thank you for your help.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
I know, but--
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
About the accident.
Because I don't know.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Anything at all?
Bobby!
You should take this seriously.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
No.
How could you let me find out like this?
The lingerie.
I don't believe it is, no.
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You got a minute?
I gotta go.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
How?
This conversation's over.
What makes you think it's you?
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
What are you talking--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Can I open 'em up?
Really?
Dad!
Do I know you?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Ssh!
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
Why would they--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Turn yourself in.
Are you okay?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
I said fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What's your ETA?
Puffed cheese?
No.
That insults them.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
What am I looking at?
Yes.  Absolutely.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
No.
You don't sew at all!
I can still taste you.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Dance with me.
Don't leave me!
Appropriate?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
What's the matter with you?
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
May God make safety your companion.
Shut-up!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Where've you been?
Ask him.
Oh, all over.
The team is in mourning, darling.
To arm-twisting.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
Are you asleep?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Your friend?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
So I follow the wires?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
What are you up to?
Will you come with me?
It's what I've learned.
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Kip?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Through a window.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Don't overestimate yourself.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Then don't.
Are you...okay?
I've got something...
It's a fake.
What about your bags?
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Nice spot.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Only a week?
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Won't take any time.
Aren't we early?
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
He wasn't.
They moved it.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Oh my god, I thought--
Transfer.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
That was a lifetime ago.
Four billion dollars.
Put this on!
What's wrong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Because I never assume anything.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
How does someone get meningitis?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
The what?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
You're a girl.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
And you can't?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Is that what I think it is?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Someone's following me.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
And, what, I'm not serious?
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
And if you had to guess ...
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
When?  Where?
Erin?  What are you --
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Yeah.
Ten?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Great.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
That's Ed.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Dr. Paulsen?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
He'll learn.
Will he finish what he begins?
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
... Luke, you must not go.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I feel The Force.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks a doleful farewell.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Han, we need you here.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
You mean a man you can control.
I do not!
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Hyperdrive.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
What about Han?
What'd you say?
You rest now.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
What's in there?
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Did you call the Zoo?
Do you have a name?
And we can watch ...
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Where do I put ashore?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Who?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
Good day to you, sir.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
Thanks to God, you are alive.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
He can be no other.
You saved me from the arrow...
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
A king must marry, after all.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
What is this place, Merlin?
But, I'm here.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
I'm sorry.
Just five or six people.
What's Burke got to do with it?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
It's serious?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Thank you.
Rats?
But it's clean?
She is going to be well?
Excuse me Miss?
A man to see you.
And those lies she's been telling?
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Oh yeah, since when?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
But how?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
What?
Um........Stuff.
We'll see when we get home okay.
I found it.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Cause I like it.
I don't know
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
You like him.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
She doesn't remeber a thing.
So what's next?
You just missed them.
She seemed fine.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Do you like films?
Withering Heights.
I've seen it.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You and Regan?
No now.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
The Lord be with you.
The Lord be with you.
Shut up!!
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Sick priest, is that it?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Are you a relative?
Yes.
Sometimes.
You're not going to drive!
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
They gotta go.
No bones?
Accident?
Twenty years, Ma ...
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Count it.
What do you think?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
It's me.
Frank?
Terrific.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
It wasn't like that.
A gust of wind killed him.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
What?
What's the matter?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Where the hell is she?
Awe inspiring.
You all right?
Just a lucky guess.
Yeah.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
First night?
I thought we had separate rooms.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
All night?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Yeah.
He was just having fun.
You could've come.
Cancel, Frank.
What disease?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Stay off it.
You weren't there.
So what'd you think?
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Actually, that's my stage name.
Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Nine.
Give me that.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Go ahead.
I don't believe it.
Uh ...
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
How come?
Funny job.
Brought it.
No.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
All right.  Hold on.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
It went well tonight.
He leads, I follow.
Pretty much.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
He do that every year?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Friend.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
So, what happened?
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
So ... ?
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
Vegetables.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Where am I?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Hey, bro ...
So?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
It's important.
Something good?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
No.
One last time.  It's important ...
Is someone there?
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Go on.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
You merciless bastard!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
You'd have to start immediately.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
Gone?
Oh, that Karl.
Where's Jamie?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Mr. Mintz.
Take you, for instance...
Jack, are you okay?
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
What are you doing?
I don’t think so.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
Give me my goddamn life back!
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Why not?
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Uh huh...
All in one tape?
Jack...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hey!  I was watching that!
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Thank you...
Not it...?
Maybe I should wait...
But you always seem so certain.
That’s a big one for me, too.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
A perk for what?
Are you okay, Jack?
Don’t get on that plane!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Can I help you?
Hey, are you okay?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I can't take this.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What did you wish for, honey?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What do you mean "complete"?
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You two need a time-out.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
And if he's not...?
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You <u>were</u>?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Victor, your scar --
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
Benes... What the devil happened?
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
Trip? Where to?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Difficult? He's impossible!
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Look at that...they're changing color...
No need to get up --
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
You left something out.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Where we going?
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Then don't drift down further.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
This is a new car, then, sir?
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Yah.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Uh-huh.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
...Brainerd?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Yah, but -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Yah, how much money was that?
No, no, fax is -
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
It's okay, Scotty.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
...Is everything okay?
Whatcha watchin' there?
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
We might be innarested.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
...There's a million dollars here!
Carl somethin'?
Call 'em up.
...Well, that passed.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
...Geez.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Yah?
...What can I get ya?
...This is a nice place.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Hello?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
What'd he say?
So... they didn't...
Oh. Oh, my.
The day of our homicides.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
There's no one else here.
You are a moron.
Yeah, both of us.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Looks like this is goodbye.
Should we?
You haven't been going to yours.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
What are you doing here?
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
No.
He's not here.
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
How have you been?
Who do you think I am?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Don't I?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
But a good strange.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Any historical figure.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
No, I'm not...
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
I feel sick.
Something on your mind?
What should I have told you?
Four in Milwaukee.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What... ?
This isn't possible...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Yes...
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
What?
One minute.
Paraffin.
Not exactly according to plan.
Why what?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Appreciate something.
Who is this?
Very good, Sir.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
What are you doing?!
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
What do you want me to do?
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
What feeling?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
That... him?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
4:25.
Most kids do, I guess.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Fag.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You comin'?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
You really got a Masters Degree?
How do we get upriver?
Are you okay?
I do?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
But now it's free, right?
Well did you or didn't you?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
Oh, no..I have to get home...
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I'm sorry.
No, I'm fine... really...
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
Parry?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where?  Maybe we can.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Fine.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Your name was picked.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Now what?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They said you're The One.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry... I'm Jack.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
It's such a great song.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Happily married, probably.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
Well, it's enough for me.
Excuse me...
No.
A wig?
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Is it my turn again?
I'm not some piece a crap.
You treat me like I was.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You're depressed that I come along.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
How far are you going to?
Hey, mack!
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
I don't make the rules.
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well...  I better let you...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Yeah, me, too...
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Why?
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
You think I'm a fake.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
Robert?
Where are you going?
I have to talk to you.
Robert, do you mind?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
It is true.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Nothin'.
You look good.
Wussup, Victor.
So what girls are over there?
A bad attitude.
Wha'?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Would you like me to change anything?
Maybe tonight?
Wonder who his supplier is.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
My God, you're serious.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
For sure?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
What?
I'm fine.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Check.
I know.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
I'm all ears.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
'Magic' today, huh?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
So were my parents.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
You ordered it here?
I mean put clothes on.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
What about his parents?
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
But I've seen the deed.
I think you better sit down.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
They just left, sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
You want I set up?
What did you want under the bed?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Utah?
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Jim Swarthout?
You don't know the Underhills?
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
You okay?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Spunk, come back...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
It has to be by the end of this week.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
He got off on six.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Where's he from?
Marseilles.
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Toy wit' this will ya.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Yeah.
What happened to you?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
What about Sal?
It was a crematorium.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Yeah.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
You're shitting me!
It looks open on the other side.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I love you, Bud.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
I swear, Satch.
Frank, please...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Okay, start pedaling.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Uh, hello?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
How could this be happening?
It's really you, isn't it?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What are you talking about?
Dad...?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What...
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Longbranch...?
My father didn't die in a fire?
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
She makes ten.
Uh, huh.
You work too hard, John.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Hell-
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
What was that?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Did you stay here last night?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
My ass.
Never should've let her play.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
What?
Uh...yes.  But...
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
You mean you had a bad dream.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Will you listen, dammit!
Why didn't you cremate him?!
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Everything going okay?
It's going.
What's the problem here?
Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
It was a community service.
Have you seen Tamara?
Really?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Well...how do you feel?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
What are you talking about?
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Where are they?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
We must abandon.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
That's awful.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
What?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Had to be him.
This could be it.
She died.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Opening night?
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
See, Daddy.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
That's very lovely actually.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Life is true.
Pop, will you let me in?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
I want to believe.
Then they lost?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
'm not worried about this kid.
Yes.
There was a review.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
He's a very sweet man.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I haven't come to you.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
No violence, please.
What'd he say?
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
Do you find me stubborn?
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Assuming we are in agreement?
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
You almost sound like you believe that.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
It's for the best.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
A man's dead, Detective.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Often.
Suit yourself.
The Mission Director.
That's not the point.
Let's get out of here.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
We can't stay here.
They'll recognize me.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Again?
Hello?
How are you, Jerome?
What will happen to the others?
I've found him too.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Have they found our friend?
Friend?
You didn't know?
I envy you, Jerome.
You'll be next.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Better than old times.
You were asleep.
Yeah... I know.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Promise you won't laugh.
Bullshit.
Yeah.
You sent me to him.
A man helped me open it...
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
You're full of ifs.
When are you going to learn?
How much?
Okay?
I want to say something.
What's wrong?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
That's right.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
What do you have in mind?
You serious?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
What's the damage?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
I made a mistake.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Address?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
What?
Who?
Yes. I met him last year.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
That's what I was wondering.
It just would. He was always the same.
How'd you know Albert?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
See you later.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
What is it?
They came back?
What you going to do?
What's that supposed to mean?
Did you sleep well?
Do us a favour?
They're friends of mine.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
You're not seeing me?
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You ever get 'em?
You did?
Eh?
It's not.
...that's right...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Nurses.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
You...
...you're absolutely right.
They have...
What?
Yes.
Yes.
Talking about it as a...
No.  Not actually.
You're actually talking about this?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
I'm sorry?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Dave.
Why would they come to me?
...you don't have to come in...
...and rob the place...
That's right.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
Uh-huh.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Yes.
Clear...
Everything I...you know...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
No, who?
Thieves.
You think so?
Did they...?
No.
You...
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
...you didn't close...
Shelly...
...no...
Moss.
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
That's alright.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Abso...
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
Fuck you, Dave...
How was it...?
From the store.
What is it?
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Home...
Rick...?
I've got to talk to you.
What would have elapsed?
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What power?
The deal.
You cashed the check?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You going to turn State's?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
I know.  How long will you be gone?
We have no money for a rug.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
The children can stay.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
Not for strangers; for my country.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
We were all upset about that.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
He's an Italian?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I asked about Fredo?
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Wait... there's something else.
Go on, tell me.
That plane goes to Miami...
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
No questions.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
This meeting is adjourned.
Kay.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
What makes you say that?
This looks corny.
What's that mean?
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You and he are not doing things?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
What?  Oh yes.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
But why?
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
Do you mind?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Why not?
What happened?
Do you miss it?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
If that's okay?
No.  The girl.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Run for what?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
That only leaves the rest.
Is that --?
I don't remember that one.
You are much too human.
What was that?
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
More your line.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
No.  I expect you can't.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
My monsters?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Who was the job for?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
Get out --
What do you mean -- ?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You got no choice. It's over.
What for?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What do you want from me?
C'mon, man ...
What about him?
Peugot convertible ...
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
How are we supposed to--
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
He's in some trouble ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
What time of year?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
You guys are through...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah -
You?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
You okay -- ?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
So I was replaced by Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Six or seven...
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
No way ...
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Now... I'm in ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What -- ?
You think it can be done?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Billy, how are you?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
What're you doing? What about the car?
What do you do?
The bag with the envelopes.
Jezuz Christ!
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Jimmy.
I better call again.
How?
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
No way! You're kiddin'!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Suck my cock!
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Why not?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
How'd you know where to find me?
Is this a bad time?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
--That isn't funny--
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
Did she get my Double Burger?
You want us to give you cash right now?
Will you take a check?
What class did you say that was?
Good, it was all right.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Really?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
--Half-red, half-black--
I don't know what it's called.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I can come back.
Uh-oh.
Sean.
Good to see you.
Yeah.
I need someone with your kind of background.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Would you excuse us?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--Gerry--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
--I'm not angry at you--
Sean...
There is somebody...
Well, she out did herself today...
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
What places?
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
I did.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Watch your mouth.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Yeah.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Where were you?
Do you think you're alone?
What?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'll keep in touch.
No. Thank you.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I really don't 'date' that much.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
I swear to God.
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Clearly.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
I want you to come with me.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I can't go out to California.
Is that what you think--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
You doin' the hirin'?
Will ya look at her!
Ready, Pa?
Ready, Ma?
Don't hold me so tight.
People done it. If they could, we could.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Kinda pie y'got?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
That's the way it is.
I ain't gonna run.
Sure do.
I stay in my own yard.
What you mean?
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
Where you think you're going?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Sometimes they do.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Ya say we're acrost?
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
Then what, Tom?
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Are you crazy?
You mean get off my own land?
Here we go!
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Really...? So what?
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Jesus...
Yes.
Tell me about yourself.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
It's always the little things.
Watched television?
Yes.
Hello...?
Do you want to get a drink first?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
--She's not dead---
Like love?
Get the fuck outta here.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Jesus Christ!
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
I'm staying here.
You know where I live?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Thank you, no.
Hard to get good help these days.
I don't think so.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
If he does our job, he's our job.
All of it?
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
Don't forget your identity.
You have.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
He sold me this bad boy.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
A jogger, huh?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
It is. It's lovely.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Why don't you go lie down?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Whatever you want.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I don't care.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
I don't believe this!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Why? There's no food in the house?
I'll come.
Well, one was for salad...
I'll take care of it.
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
So do you.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
You've already made arrangements!?
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
I miss you, Annie.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
About what?
I don't understa-
I have so much to tell you.
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
They fired you?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
What?
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I can't...
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
It's warmer than I thought.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
You're looking fit.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Snoop onto them...
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
It was him, man!
Yeah?
Who's that?
Mm-hmm.
That's bullshit.
Talk to me.
Fucked if I care, man.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
If I win, you become my slave.
We need your help.
Thank you.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
You look good in a dress.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey, it's me.
You think they're going to bust us?
Virus?
What the hell was that all about?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Murphy kid turn you down?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
What is it? What's wrong?
Thank you.
What number please?
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
I'll take you down there.
Don't get angry.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What's going on?
Who's that?
Go!
An accident?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
How do you know their not?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Like a real sister?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Jamie!
What are you doing out here alone?
You don't believe that do you?
Why?
That's all the windows, Dad.
Hi Rachel.
Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
You look sharp. You understand?
This is 132, over.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
What are we doing?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
When he makes that call.
Where's that Deputy?
How's it powered?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Sort of.
You blame everything on kids.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Sure, see you later.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
I don't know.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
What do we do?
You all right?
Yes, I am.
There is no such thing.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
The bogyman!
How?
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
There's nothing else I can do.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Pull up to the entrance!
...any sister talk?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
No, he called late last night.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
It's really sad.
We could...we could do that.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
How ya doin', man?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Oh, Elliot!
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Where are you headed?
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yeah.  How are you?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Was I?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Are you?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Are you sure?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm...
...or films you must see or... 
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Why?
So you met somebody else?
N-n-no, not that.
Hello?
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Yes, please.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
You look so beautiful.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
So how are you?
No.
I'm okay.
Ohh!
Gee.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Hey, hi!
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Thanks for a swell time.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
I remember you.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, well.
Really?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Just a few minutes ago.
Hi.
Or, perhaps...
It's a growth business.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
That would adversely impact my income.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
What, What, I can't hear you...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
He escaped...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
...and then, he'll be coming down.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Let the girl go.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Yes sir, I saw it. 
You nervous...?
I said how's your baby...?
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error. 
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Why did you look at me that way?
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
We got KittyKat...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
Indeed we were.
<u>Yes</u>.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Give me your gun...
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Ask me when we get home.
I know where he is.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Thank you.
Brazilian. 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
I..
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Yes.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
...yes...?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
You think you're so...but you're just...
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Goodnight, Jasper.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Do you really not believe in God?
Not now, Wendy.
It's not my style, okay?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Oh, I have to hear this.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
What are you doing here?!
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
I said I was sorry.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Don't talk to me like that.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
What are you doing?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
I don't know. Should you?
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
And your worst enemy.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Mute!
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Did to.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
If you'll excuse me......
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Answer him dick!
Let's kick his ass.
I think so, man.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Turn that back on!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Look who I've found!
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Bye.
Hello!
He's the manager!
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Well, I guess I take after you then!
hurries over.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
It doesn't matter.
What??
Mummy!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Your insight is enlightening.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
What?
Really? Do tell.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
What?
A little? Try unbelievably.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
I don't work here.
What's under that sheet...?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
LaPlante!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
You!
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
He lost a shoe!
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Okay.
Was that your dad?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
No, no, no, no.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Yeah, that was easy.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Neil, calm down.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I thought we'd be happy here.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
I have a cold.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
You sure?
Good evening, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Yes -- I think it is.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
As friends -- always as friends.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why not?
Are you a cop?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
I'll be fine.
On the back it has--
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
We found him this morning.
I don't think it is a duplication.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
I understand.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
You think we should take that chance?
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
I have to tell you something --
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
I'm here.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
I'm not gonna leave you!
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Kevin left without you.
What happened?
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Louise?
You have her cell number?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
You want me to stick around, I could --
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
What's my name?
Not until the man calls.
How about you and your sister?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Ten.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
What's happening?
Anything. Strong.
Their people?
They fired a rocket at us.
The United Nations are still here.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites?
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Perfect timing.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Who did you call?
How much?
Your brother's here?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
They are being evacuated.
What about us?
But who is left?
Go to the roof now.
What for Paul.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I have a confession. When we met...
What?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?
I want to know.
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to have a plan.
What sort of plan?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You have taken business class?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
What is this about no water?
The staff and guests! How many?
Why the hurry, Roger?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Don't think it'll be a problem.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
Shit, Pritchett!!!
I'll meet you down there.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
I don't think so...
You okay?
...Jesus H. Christ.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- wit...nesses --
You didn't think to ask?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Do something!
I think...I may have the answer.
Vannacutt!!
Please! I need your help.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Oh, no.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Ghosts killed your father?
For the love of God....please...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
It might have been her mother.
What will they tell you?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
What do these ingredients mean?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
My angel!
She says she's lonely...
Help me!  Please!!!
To our family.
What the hell is that?
...set up some more things.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
What are you talking about?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
It was a shame.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
This isn't happening...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Something bad.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Uh-huh?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
No.  We want ...
I don't know.  Maybe.
A prize?  For what?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Oh, I don't ...
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
You re not thinking of going to...
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Why not just go now?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
That was close....
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Hit me with your best shot.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Oh, you read that.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
I was the Warden?
Catholic girls are scary...
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Bunny, not you too?
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
This is the worst night...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
About seven minutes.
Cigarette?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Watch it, Archer --
I got big ideas, though!
How long've you been down here?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Norville.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
...Enter the dame.
Yellowstone.
She's good, Bennie.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Alive?
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Does she suffer?
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Yes -- on the boat.
I wish I hadn't heard --
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
Why did you come in here?
You didn't drive her mad.
I wanted to help you.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
She was beautiful.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
You want that?
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
I don't know -- I don't know--
An accident at the mill?
What about her?
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Elena.
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Anyone special? You know...
Hnnn.
Yeah.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Dad stop it!
Fascist!
Your toes cold?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
-- What advice? You never --
But what?
A key party?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, we can talk about it.
Who?
How'd you know?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Major.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You going to tell dad?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Yeah.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
My what?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Mikey?
Where you going?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
With who?
Is this Charles?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Communist Viet Cong.
Want a drink?
I had him!
I have to get back.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
What about your shoulder?
I'll call him now.
What?
That's right.
Did she?
That's right.
You know I remember that.
Looks like the natives are restless.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's a long time.
You don't know.
It was like some big fucking secret!
No game.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
Yes.
Then so was mine...
Your lips, they didn't move.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
We want no quarrel with him.
More.
I want some more.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Claudia - don't -
You... fed on me?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Louis, look at me.
What was that?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
That's not so.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Then my luck would have changed.
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You're sure?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
But how do you know?
You fool, what have you done?
Lestat - finish this -
Unless I make her one of us...
Lestat!
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
What about coffins?
You loved Yvette...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
No way.
Be careful, Julie.
I'm holding your hand!
Ray, I can't...
Checking the locks again?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Deep breaths --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
You sure it's okay with you?
What do you mean, Julie?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why?
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Where is everybody?
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Where'd Estes go?
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
) You feel the symptoms?
My friend -- what can one say --
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
What an odd question!
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
It was, the plague
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
That your father and I ——
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
How did she die?
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
You have no car.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
I . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Who is it?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
You sent for me, sir?
Splendid! Is he sick?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Thanks.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Well?
When'd you see him last?
What?
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Oh . . .
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
You want a martini?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but . . .
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Why didn't you call me?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Yes, sir.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Well, what about all your other friends?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Do you like it?
Don't you like her?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
I've eaten.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Your dad must be really pissed.
You coming up on him?
Chief....
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
I can't let you take her out.
Do I have to?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
May I have this dance?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Okay, so that's it.
And sound.
All summer?
It was bad, wasn't it.
What?
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
That's it?
Can I go with you today?
They made me go with them.
What's wrong?
You're not going out right away, are you?
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
No class.
Shut up.
What's that mean?
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
About damn time.
Faster!  Faster!
When are we going out?  You and me?
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
So?  So?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
He's going with you, Doctor.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Are you scared?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
I talked you into this?
You all right?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Yes.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
No, we'll go through here.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Michael, you're not going down there.
No, no.  That won't do.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Get ready to go.
How you doing, Kelly?
Herpes?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
Let's go, let's go!
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
The space shuttle has landed!
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Yeah, poor bastard.
No, South Georgia.
No way.
What kind of trouble?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Thea....
But you always let me....
Daddy, why can't I...?
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
It sure is good to be home....
Where have you been...?
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Henny Youngman....
Michael!  This thing working?
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
We don't want any....
Can I ride one sometime...?
You're coming, aren't you...?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Okay.
You could teach...You could....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Flies the plane....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No, you're not....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Why?
I'm sorry...I....
I can't....
You the architect?
Hurry!
I hope she's a good sailor....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
I wish there was something I could do....
How many...?
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Stop busting my hump....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
When I signed on....
Hoagie.
You told me what?
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
How's the new residence?
Because, don't get into it ...
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
You want my advice?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Why's she blind, Bro?
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What is that?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
No.
That's bullshit,
Yes, Sir.
Can I see your hands?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No.
Oh.
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I know.
You know? How do you know?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
You got a warrant for this?
Two or three years ago.
You think John would like it?
Is that Margie?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Shut up, King Jay ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
There is something missing here.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Well, thanks.
You think so?
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
It's all going to work.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Truth?
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
If I said that, would you stay?
What --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
So this break... is a break-up.
Wait. Where is he?
I heard.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Denver is where he should be.
Mmm.  Hmm.
I got it.
At last I find you.
No, I air-dry.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
I'll get you some quick work --
How do I know?
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Jerry!  You made it --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
No.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I'm scared.  What is it?
Eric!
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
He says it's a bad idea!
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
You couldn't have made that jump.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Raptors, mostly.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
But then you never get to go in space.
No. I couldn't see.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You hear something?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Dad!
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
She's gutty.
Then this is our chance.
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
You think this is all a joke?
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
The door security systems are shutting down.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
But would we get the phones back?
What?  No menthol?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
We were right!
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
- - like birds - -
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
Why not?
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
I threw up.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
You got any kids?
Why?
Yeah, they hate me.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
You're sure?!
We gotta do something.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
What kind of opinions?
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
I hate trees!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
No, but...
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I really think we should go back...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
What?
Who?
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
He's fucking nuts.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
How long will the effect last?
An empty tomb?
Another one?
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
In a small way.
How long were you and Eduard --
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Are you free tonight?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Why were you given notice?
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
No -- not this time.
-- Listen to me --
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
What did she say?
... Why take me into your confidence?
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
... A piece of paper ...
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
Orlac is an account?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
I want to thank you.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
We're leaving.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Native costume?
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
It must have been terrifying?
What about him? Yes.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
Yes?
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Don't belong?
Look -- could I use your phone?
A few more days. We know who did this.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
I guess he figured it was better.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Why?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
I don't see anything, do you?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
-- Then you don't need me.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Please.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Go down in my room.
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
You're going back?
What?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Some mistake perhaps that --
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
What else do you know?
Show.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
I hate it.
I want a pizza.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Is mom ever coming back?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.
Yes?
Objection.
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Was there Burger King?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection.
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Yes...
Somewhere in between.
Yes.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
You want what?!
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Joanna, I don't give a--
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
And?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
What?!  She wants what?!
No, but--
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Three.  And add some basil.
California?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Thelma, if I die--
What?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Mama, my story.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
But, I am in charge.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Here. We'll collect them.
Can I free the prisoners?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
With much bloodshed.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
I am scared.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
What does the butter spot feel like?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Pretend.
Tell me.
I do.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Why are we landing?
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
He never said "go".
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Right.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
You talk to Bickerman?
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Such the flirt.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Oh my God.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Baby crocs?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
Good.  See ya soon.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
No thanks.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
Get him onto shore.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
He's done.  He's dying.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
You talk to the married couple?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
What?
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Kelly.
The somebody else part?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
You and Kevin.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
I don't know! Get me out!!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Miggs has been murdered.
Why?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
It's much better than your shoes.
I have no doubt of it.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
All flayed...?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
I heard a strange sound...
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Dr. Lecter -
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
What...?
Time, Pilch! My move.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
Are we safe?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
There was none!
There was no letter.
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
I see...
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Yes. Go ahead.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Who were these people?
Any powder?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
What happened to you?
Sir!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
France.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
He did.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Doc eat already?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
You did good...
What?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Twenty minutes...
Okay, number 23's full.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
No fuckin' lie...
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
I'll kill him!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Well?
You fucking well have to get 'em!
I hate these Southern shites.
Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
They were going to pay, then?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Is that you, Dean?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
We gotta get those guns.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
No.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Well, what did he say?
You will what?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
At what, exactly?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Six.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
You jerk--
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I-I can do the job, sir.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
We're not running a dating service here.
Yeah.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
What's that for?
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
So they stayed in Florida?
Dad--?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Are we going to ever see your father?
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
And people make their choice--
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
"Mas cerveza por favor."
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Bledso
We have a murder?
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Steve called for you.
Steve?
Your mother's family is Spanish?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Why would I want to go there?
I was too busy.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
And my father?
People didn't complain?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
How come?
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Yeah--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Yeah.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
You heard right.
Take a look at this.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I wasn't.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
... oh... God...
Is it finished?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I heard he was the best.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Any movie stars buried here?
What for?
I like to know why things happen.
Yeah, I know.
Are you satisfied now?
Shit...
What about?
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
She has no real grip on reality.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Not much.
At birth.  I don't know you --
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Is that all?
They got here before us.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Yes! Yes!
And he's dead?
Fuck you.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm thinking about it.
Oh, what do you do with that?
Oh, hi.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Oh, for her show?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
It's bad isn't it?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Yes.
Hello, darling.
Bob?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello?
Fine. Is it going ok?
When are you coming home?
Hospital?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Hair stuff?
Do you think it's done?
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Must be a spare set.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I'll bet.
I had to.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
So what?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Get up!!
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
What can I do?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
I know who he is.
We need all the help we can get.
You don't want to face it.
Good of you to stop by.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
How're you doin' today?
What happened?
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Nothing.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Engaged.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's ridiculous.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
You're a caterer?
Coach...
I'm an English major.  You like English?
I don't wanna see that.
I don't know sometimes.
Mom's going to hate it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
What's up?
Well, what do you know.
How's that been?
You do act different.
I don't care.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
For how long?
Way to hoop.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Figures.
I can't be nice to a fan?
Forget Tonya Randall.
Quincy...
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Just something I'm trying.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Funny.  I never did.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Business folks.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
What's that, not great?
Quincy, please...
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What?
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
Don't sit down.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
No.
Bit messy.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
The gentleman who came to the door --
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
This is my job.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
If you're not here for a 422 --
Well...is that illegal?
No, no.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm sorry.
Can I tell you something?
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
What?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Sure, why?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
No.
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
What happend?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Stay that way.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I need to sit down.
...ah...
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
...Lily...?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Alright.  Thank you.
I'm gonna start rolling --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
This isn't meant --
It's all important --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And what did your parents do?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I'm sorry.
Not a problem.
What name?  My name?
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
He's in here --?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
I won't.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
No.  No.
That's it.
How long with Paula?
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
...Jimmy...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
What does that mean?
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Partridge?
Bottled Water?
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
That's it.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
....Why does he do it...?
I have money.
No, M'lady.
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
I am preparing for a ball!
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
He is your brother!
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
It can.  I know the way.
He who is not with us is against us.
And people close to him, who --
Three days.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
But --
So what has changed?
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
There are more important things than tits.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
But why?
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
What use am I?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
Where are you going?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
How did you know -- ?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I was told this impostor was dead!
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
... Nothing.
Raoul... is in love...
The food doesn't please you?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
So what?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
And he took a swing at you?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Captain?
No...
What's going on here?
I had it all on tape...
No -
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
I've got a better idea...
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How are Molly and the boy?
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Run it.
What?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
What?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
How did you come to Gateway?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
You'll let me go now?
Yes?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
I don't want to do that,
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
To yourself...
We have it good, don't we?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I remember.
No.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
What's the problem, Molly?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Are you George Sherman?
Yeah...
I figured I'd ask you...
Are you gonna kill him?
She got all right?
...after a while.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Yes.
What do you want?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
I hope you have a second chance...
George, I hate sitcoms.
Andy?
So how can I help you...?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Ten.
No thanks.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Hey Andy, good show.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Goals are important.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
You don't know.
You're two hours late.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Yes.
How long?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Tank.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
You're the Oracle?
That vase.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
They're watching you, Neo.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Why?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
What did she tell you?
What happened?
What?
What are you doing?
No, you're not.
You don't have...
Zion?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Which way?  Which way?
Tank, you're hurt.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
What just happened?
They've burned through the outer shields.
Look fella...this is private...
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Panther...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
I don't like loading crates.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Hey...you got nothing here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Oh Michael, look...
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Diane, how are you feeling?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Oh...around...why?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Please take it.
It's all right.
What is it now?
Scumbag--
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
How much?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
You ate?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Oh, the goddam party --
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
...See you tomorrow night.
Cold.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Certainly, Bill.
You're overthinking it --
Are you?
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
He said that?
I from dat nex' place.
Can't, sistah.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Rass!
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Jennifer.
I didn't know that.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
How did you meet?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I am Joe.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
I've got plenty of friends.
No.
'To bed'?
-- Could you?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
...No.
I love you in an evening gown.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Susan --
When you go, I go.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
You were just curious?
About Susan?
What's okay?
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
What the hell do you care?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
You should hope quite a while.
I don't!
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
Next week?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
How did you know?
I don't like to interfere.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
21.
79.
Should I wear it?
You don't know?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
What makes you think he's my friend?
A cop?
What?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Jimmy?
I don't want blood on them.
Strip!
You think you can bargain with me?!
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
Such as?
And what did he say?
What does he want?
Neither do I.
Don't protect him.
Calm down.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Did Teddy send you?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
You said you were leaving town.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Shut it, Teddy.
What's wrong with this one?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
I didn't sell -
How'd you know I was in here?
How do you know this?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
Somehow, I'll know!
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
So who are you saying he was?					*
No. You took them out.						  *
Bullshit.							*
Turn around.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
We're not certain...
Tell them what you want.
Havana.
I insist.
Is it December?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Yero, by himself?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Yeah?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Then you should.
Yeah...?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Why?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You sure you heard what I said?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
I ain't sleepy.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
What's in your socks?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Tell her, Ratso.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Gin's okay.
What?
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Uh, yessir.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You really want to do business?
What?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
Those mountains? are they?
Yes...?
Just what?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Yeah.
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Never was anybody like you...
Know what?
Who got the Frenchman out?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
We'll be back at the platform in...
Is there a switch?
He's special.
But the power...
Manny...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
No, Jesus, no.
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Gross. What is it?
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What is it?
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
You're very kind...
No, what is it?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Then light the match, Paul.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
What?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Annie, what is it?
Don't talk to me like that.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
That's nice.
Just leave it, all right?
Oh, I like that tone.
What is it?
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
No, the typing kind.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I thought you were over it.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
To win?
You picked another winner!
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Where?
Nyah!
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
And the check's in the mall.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
- right..where is it?
- torque wrench.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
What's you name?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So where did I got right?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
I'd like a little more conviction..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Much.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
What did you think you were doing!
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
What did you think of him?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
Left jacket pocket?
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Luther, say again.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
So what do you suggest?
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Satisfied?
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Kittridge...
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Theyíre dead.
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Yeah.  I follow you.
What?
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
On what?
It's quite out of the question.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Jack.  Jack.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
What problem?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Loud and clear.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Yes...  Itís him.
Itís not working.
No, I'm going.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I don't like him.
Rita. Pass the wine.
You're welcome.
I have my eyes open.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Ti amo.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I got it done.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Why you looking around so much?
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Yes.
He knew my husband who died.
Instantaneous.
To the bed.
I was dead.
Oh my God.
Take it easy.
What did I do?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What do you want to do now?
It's really cold.
Ronny!
No. I'm gonna wait.
I got things to do.
Maybe you're right.
What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Yes, on the floor.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
I have no secrets from my family.
Where's pop?
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Johnny...
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Don't shit where you eat.
Yes.
No.
People home.
That's my house.
Look.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
I don't know.
She's got it.
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
...What?
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Please!
Am I right?
We don't have a lord.
Well, how did you become king, then?
A what?
One that looks nice.
And not too expensive.
Oh, please!
I move for no man.
'Tis but a scratch.
Come on then.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Look!
Stop that.
You'll what ... ?
Well, what are you then?
Nu!
Too late.
Where?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Sorry ...
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Yes ...  make sure ...
The Castle Anthrax?
I don't think I was.
Sir Gawain.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I speak as I find, Archie.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Do you?
There are important papers from --
Don't think I can't persuade her.
What brings you here?
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
You sent for me.
I'm not married.
Why do you think I keep her here?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
To keep out the cold.
Must they always follow us?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Mrs Brown.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Dear oh dear.
Just them?
Why?
How long has he been this sick?
What do they want?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
What's the question mark?
Dead?
He?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Hello?
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
You mean we learn the rules...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
What are you going to do?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Our time's up.
Yes...
It's the wrong way!
That's impossible.
And?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
I'll speak to someone.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
So, what did they say?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Well, I ...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Wow!
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Right. See ya.
Very pleased to meet you.
Hi.
No. I can't.
But it said #12.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
I think I've been hurt.
No...I need to sleep.
Okay... but just...just to see.
What's wrong with that?
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
Don't stop!
Do you know them?!
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Oh boy.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Find out who they are?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
Good morning. What do you have today ?
Why should we trust you ?
Why should I ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
I'm listening.
What's the trick here ?
We drown.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
I... I .....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
This is cute.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
What about you ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Yeah a real shame.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
Be very, very quiet...
Don't.
Stop the hydraulics.
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
When you are ready.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Zachary.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
Bruce has just awaken.
<<belch>>
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Really ? On a date ?
Hello.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Shut up ! It's me.
Good morning.
Are you writing a poem?
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Suspended from school, my mother??
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Seriously?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Reason? What reason?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
oh.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Then I have come to the right place.
This is really very nice of you.
He's writing. Hello?
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
You ratted on my mother??
DON'T!!!
My mother stood on this very spot.
And you'd be my cousin?
No problem.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Oh...what's that?
I think this place is just fine.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
She'll be all right baby.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
What do you mean?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
What's that?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Oh, how do you mean?
It's nice.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Are you mad at me?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Kiss me.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Pointing upwards Look...
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
He was allergic to bees.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi.
Will you tell her I came by?
Thank you. Bye.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Shut your big fat mouth!
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
I would.
Uh huh.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
What are you saving for?
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It'll bleed.
Your lip bleeding?
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
Here.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Run faster they're after us!!
But I have my clothes on!
I don't like her.
Like they do on TV?
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Needs salt.
We'll never be the same.
Impressive.
I wish.
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
Well, we're...
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Uh, Kimmy...?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
It doesn't say th...
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Should I whistle down a cab?
You never eat when you're despondent.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Where did we first hear th...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Michael...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Well.  How come she didn't...
... your one chance for true happiness?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Why would she come here...
What is that sup...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I hate that music.
You're from out of town?
What's wrong honey.
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
That's what he wants.
Bastard
You're kidding.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Not yet.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
What?
Can I help you?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
She had on high heels?
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Nashville.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Does their hair fall out?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well...How have you been?
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Wrong.
When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.
Well...
Yea.
Linnea?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
What for?
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Did it break?
What?
You go to school together?
Where are you from?
Who?
Is that good?
You think it will?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Naw, she don't mind.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Who is we?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Not good.
Ready.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Do you miss Mallory?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Tell me about the purity.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Yeah, we have a van.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
Just wait one fucking minute.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
You can't be serious?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Wayne---
And where do you keep Mickey?
Waitin' in the lounge.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Two guys?
And me.
Don't call my men assholes.
It sure is.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
That's right.
Okay.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I said: Cut it out!
What did you say your name is?
They say your dad's 'round town.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Oh yeah?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Yes, aren't you?
That's right.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
No.
I like a place with lots of life.
Hell!
You almost got into trouble back there.
What d'you mean?
I didn't know you had one.
Are you married?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
What's he like?
Huh?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
What about your boy?
Don't do that!
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
There's nothing to say.
Duff--
A whole lot, Frankie.
That's right.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
What happened?
No.
That's right.
How 'you gonna live?
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Hello.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Let's stay here, Will.
What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Let's go.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
How long's it been?
What about her?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Are you even really alive?
Ready?
Right...
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
I know who you are.
And we really do have to talk.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
How soon is soon enough?
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Case... it's four a.m.
Case... Are you alright?
He projects with neural implants.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Get up.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
YOU DID.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Yeah.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
You don't think I can do it.
Wings?
Do I want to be crunched?
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
How many times have I fired her?
Five-- Six--
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Hey--what are you thinking about?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
wasn't even thinking about-
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
I know.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Well, are you here with anybody?
Yes.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That is so sad --
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
Taste it.
No.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Oh, come on Dad...
What the hell are you talking about?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
I figured you might like some help.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
I'm not hungry.
Hi.
So, school going alright?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Yor dad picking the music again?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
So what do we do about this creep?
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
What's that?
Are you okay?
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What?
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Sorry.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
I can't believe I just did that.
Stop blaming yourself.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
I've heard crazier things this week.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
What are you talking about?
Science...I suppose.
Cooling down.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Uh, fourteen.
C'mon.
Now you're lying.
I'm an actress.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Really, no.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
What did you say?
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
You've got big feet.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Can I stay a bit longer?
How are you doing?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
You disappeared.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Does the girl have a name?
Yes.
The movie star?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
In a depressingly asexual way.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
And we intend to use them!
Da Vinci?
Blimey.  What's that?
I agree.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
So it could have been neither of them?
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Max.  This is Anna.
Do you ever masturbate?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
Oh God no.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
No, 'fraid not.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
What's going on?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Fabulous.
Excuse me.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Why?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
M-m-m-ma'am?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
Get up, Billy.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
I wanna report a robbery!
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
H-Hey, M-Mack.
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
In ya go...
M-M-M-Mack?
Say... God Bless America!
Wait a minute...
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
What?
Neither do I...
Did to me?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
With your own two hands?
He can't hear you!
I'm the coach!
Bet a nickel!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Yeah, it's cold!
I'm afraid not.
When?
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
You think it's funny, huh?
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Okay. How you doing?
Hey, how ya doin'?
He's in charge.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Whew! Hiya, boys!
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Is he in an asylum?
Oh, yeah...
She was your sister.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
No.
No...
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
What's mezzaluna?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Hi there...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
What?
He's out by the pool right now.
Do you want me to do it?
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
I know the feeling.
Is something the matter?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Very funny.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Excuse me?
Scientologist.
Is everything okay?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, what's your point?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have a passport.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
That was a long time ago.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Who said I was going?
No.  No, you go ahead.
He's a jerk.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
It's siesta.
Huh?
No, why?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
What?  You know him?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
She what?!
I have to talk to her.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Mania.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
It'll do.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
That's right... .
Why Edie, I—
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
I'll get home all right now.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
In braids? That's right.
I can get home all right from here—
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Listen, you like beer?
In a saloon?
How do you like it?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
What for?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
I don't rate it.
Terry, what's wrong?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me— he says it's up to me.
What I did to Joey.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Well, it's over.
He wanted to see me again.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
Now don't give me a hard time.
You still call it ratting?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I'm just resting my feet.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
How'd you get that.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Where?
What can we do?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
But they are not yet one of us.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
It's Richard Ripley.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
Jack?
Whatta you think?
You tell your sister about it?
Now that's a really big house.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
I get that feeling, yeah.
Jack --
Hello, Daniel.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Shut up.
That's all I wanted to know.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Not until recently.
Boy, it stunk in there.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
How many was that?
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
How do we do that?
You won't do that.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
Oh, God...
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
In the trunk?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I thought you guys were busted.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
How are you, Richard?
The flight?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
That time?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
How you know that?
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
What are you thinking about?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
So?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
That's me, Sir.
Hale-what?
Home of the brave!
How could you do this?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
What facts are those?
I was grieving too.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Well...sure.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
We can explain, Colonel.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Boxin'.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
I have'na been able ta --
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Charlie really has a great voice.
But you love me don't you?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Would you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I just can't trust you anymore.
What?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
Oh, God, Dion.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
I beg your pardon?
Don't get your hopes up.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
I'd love to.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
This morning was good.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Sort of.
What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
What do you mean?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Sort of.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
Give me some credit, will you?
Come on. You can't be serious.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
What do they do up there?
All set?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
I know, Mom.
Bob...
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks, you guys.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
What's wrong with you?
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
I'm ready...
Ready for what, baby?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Thanks, Charles.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I buy that.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Find a lawyer?
What's her name?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
They didn't fire her?
We're friends of Beckett's.
What do you want?
I know a good probate lawyer.
What kind of person is that?
Yes.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
I'm fine.
Objection!
Leave that.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Get real.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You're the asshole, buddy.
How did you do that?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Gonna lose everybody out here....
You came for us....
What about her?
As fast as you can.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Just give me your hand.
You'd die for them?
You barely know them.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Can we switch?
Hey, who?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
What?
Like what?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
He can pilot?
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?
We're just burnin' light here.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
One is all?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Say that again.
Think about that reward, Johns.
Well, what's it look like now?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
You were tryin' to kill him too.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Yo!
That way.
Will he live?
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
He's trying to form words.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
long pause) You know it.
If only we could get a fix.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Can we take a dip?
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I think you're making a mistake.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
How so?
You lied. Where is your tribe?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit --
Then there is another jungle?
Listen-
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Taylor, please --
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
I SHIT on all o' you.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Says he can't walk.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
I got one...
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
...there's nobody.
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Vancouver, B.C.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Indefinitely?
I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
The brush-off, huh?
I think you're drunk.
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
You tried to run away.
There wasn't any plane.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Certainly not to me.
Just who are you, anyway?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
They'll look for you.
Killaine...
See anything?
If you're doing all this just for me.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Me?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
We wouldn't have met at all.
If I understand what you meant by that.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Martini.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Time for a little chat?
I wouldn't know.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
Doesn't answer the question.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
I think so.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Did you ever have a serious operation?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
And if you didn't believe me?
No doubt about that one.
So far.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I have a rough idea.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
It's kind of you to see me.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
It's fine, thank you.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
I will, thanks.
Shall we go?
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Me too.
Might?
Oh yes.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
You're so famous now.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It was last year.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Thanks for stepping in.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
You never were...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
They don't go for the vault?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
Nothing?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Who's the girl?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What are you talking about?
You had enough?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Well, I saw you and--
Bye.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Mean anything to you?
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
What, Sergeant?
You're looking well, Dutch.
Mmmnnn...?
Hawkins?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Mr. Harris.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Yes.
The price just went up to ten.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
And why do you say that?
It's a very good year.
Where'd you go?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
By breaking up a company's assets --
What?
Of course.  How much?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
You still mad at'm?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Fuck off.
Do I look okay?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Where are you taking me!?
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was good.
You're packing.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Cynthia's not coming?
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
'Lo.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
It was great.
I pray for that.
Go for the bucks.
What kind of school?
I'm just going to my room.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
What if they serve soup?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
What is with you?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
He knows I do not love him.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I will never doubt again.
We'll never survive.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
I don't think more than ten.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Yes.
Now?
Now?
No.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He's already dead.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Humiliations galore!
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Get used to disappointment.
You're sure nobody's following us?
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
But that's cheating!
Yes, what?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What???
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
You found a flop!
What is she gonna do here?
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
No way out.  No way out.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Yes.
We swear it!
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
But he has long hair!
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Get car.  Get car.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
The following morning. Sunday.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
What's your interest?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
With the forty thousand dollars?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
May I talk to you?
Lila.
Is something wrong?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
I was getting to that!
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
He didn't come back here?
Without calling me?
In a hurry.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
I've lost my girlish laughter.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I can come down next week.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
You eat like a bird.
You go out... with friends?
I'm looking for a private island.
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Why don't you go away?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Very early. Dawn.
May I see your license?
Just coming up to ring for you.
It isn't necessary.
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Was that all?
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
You didn't find anything.
No mother.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
No-
Who are you? What is your name?
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Well, news of Buckley?
I'm going to call the police.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
A voice ...
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
You lie!
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Meaning what?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
And they never proved anything against him.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
I am right! I know I'm right!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What do you mean?
Almost certain.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
How's every little thing?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Cry-baby?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Oh, is that what caused it?
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
To lunch.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
What are you laughing at?
I'd know him anywhere.
What was her name?
I've been dreaming about you.
Where to?
We flopped the first time out.
Could be.
What universe are you in, Paul?
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
But who were they?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
'Course it does.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Okay.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I do, too!
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
You were up late last night, Brother.
Well, a little.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What'd you say, Brother?
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
Yeah.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Is her husband sick or something?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
I am ahead of you.
Please do.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
She does look a little peaky.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
You're so sweet.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Strange voices, Rose?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Tennessee?
No, you're not.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Well, you run on now.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Never again, never again...
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
I was going to tell him.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Lay off once, would you?
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
No you can't.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Wh... what... ?!
What's mine say?
Where we going?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
How'd we do?
What the hell's his problem?
You suck at lying, Archie.
Yeah.
You always did have style.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Jabba's palace.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I thought she was with you.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
Yes.
Lando, grab it!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
What are you telling them?
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Good shot, Red Two.
Over there! Two more of them!
Just...images, really. Feelings.
He's my father.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
I've got something to say.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
What was that bang?
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Hello.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Want to come again and stay
Feeling
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Creature of the night.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
I just dislocated my finger.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think I belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Would ya take off your glasses?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yes.
Don't you open them anymore?
...Are you going to say anything to him?
...What?
I can't go out.
Why?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Paulie!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
One more round.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Don't like yours neither.
...That's an old one.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Six!
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
That's it, I'm broke.
Yeah.
No action.
...Thanks.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah, Kayo.
Rice is a bum.
Think about it.
When was they here?
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
...What?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
I got pain an' experience too.
How am I doin'?
Wanna keep goin'?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Why?
I'll do okay.
How ya feelin'?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Does it hurt?
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
You shot Roger.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Have you got the will?
Maybe.  Why?
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Safe?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
Yeah?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Leave Me!
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Ay me!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
If my heart's dear love--
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
That dreamers often lie.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Is she a Capulet?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Do you really think so?
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Lose them!
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I didn't say I was.
We'll double your price.
Bad company...
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
But you hate each other!
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Not exactly.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
It's been known to happen.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Perhaps the police?
What'd you say to him?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
I just wanted to see something.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
You see the bullet?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
I don't know...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Gaelic.
My man, how you doing?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Do you have the tape?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Damn.
Seven thousand...
Never heard of it.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
No.  We can't.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
What makes you so sure?
At the expense of six people.
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
That's not what I mean.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
What are you thinking?
That's not what I mean.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
And how do you figure we do that?
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
It's NOT too late!
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Just take it in stride.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
OK.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
I don't know, Booth.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
What?
And what's that?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
She's not his type.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Whatever...
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Did they ever find out who they were?
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
No, sir.
Winner six!
The band has been playing over an hour.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
How you doin'?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
Follow the Rich White Man?
Excuse me?
It's your turn!
She never even looked at you.
Why did you help me?
Fine with me.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
Very nice.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Baby Duck?
Any leads?
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Ricky Tan?
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Good job.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Right....
Shortcut?
He was trying to kill me, not you.
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Now, that's American music.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Are you OK?
Oh no, I dropped it.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How about a lift home?
At this point we don't have much.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I was trying to find the right time.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
"Make the shot."
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Thank you.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Five hundred.
I think so.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
I already explained about that.
Lost!
I love you.  I love you.
And the church.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
But I'm weird.
He's going to be the pastor?
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
What?
No, you tell her.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Does it have wheat in it?
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
You couldn't.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
Men never get this movie.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
I love you, too.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
This is a photo of hair.
No, I'm not. 
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
Are his folks nice?
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
It's not that late in Seattle.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll like it.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Dad?  About last night?
What?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
Will she scratch up your back?
Like do you believe in heaven?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Dad!
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
It's a short word.
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Who is Annie?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did not.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
It's a little derivative.
Hi.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
Forget it.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Over my dead body.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
No.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Will you be still?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Where's your mama?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
That's it?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Everything go?
Leave me out of this.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
It's not that easy.
Then leave.
Why not?
How much time do you have?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
You can still work.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Why?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Palmdale
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy.
What's this?
Okay
When? When did you ever see me use?
No one ever noticed?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Not bad.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Shoot him.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
You've got no choice.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Turns out he's connected.
We know what's going on.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Really?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You think that's a good idea?
What is it, drugs?
Casualties?
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Jackson?
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Y'all come back.
I'd love to hear it.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
White-walls?
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It was nothing.
Upham?
Over three-hundred.
But, sir...
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Simpson.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Is it getting worse?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
You're welcome, John.
Uh, oh.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Sure, Reiben.
Ours is not to reason why.
Huh?
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Why's that?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
What's the profile?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Because he's guilty.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I hope you understand.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Yeah.
What's a scam?
Then what's love?
Lloyd, give it up.
Yes.
Did you sleep with her?
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
I don't feel anything.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Oh yeah!
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
I love you dad.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad.
Morning.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
What happened to you?
What am I supposed to think?
Yes, I...
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Well, not monumentally.
I'll go.
What?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Nice one.
Okay.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
You do?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
You're freaking out here man.
Uh... okay... um...
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
I'm totally and completely serious.
Are you?
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
No way.
Hey.
Yeah.
I called her up.
Give me my firebird keys!
I love you man.
Later for you, Luke.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
In Breslau.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
What's going on?
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
It kind of looks that way.
What others?
I think it's too late.
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
Would it do any good?
What is it?
Stop it...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Cici. Who's this?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
What if I said goodbye?
Cotton.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
This is exactly what I don't want.
Let us decide that.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No. This is a set up.
Need some help, honey.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
You have every right to be upset.
I think you're all an act.
What are we looking for?
..and as lonely as I am...
Jesus Christ!
Don't worry...
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Just in case...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Sid, I'll come with you.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Where is your attacker?
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Easy black boy.
You're not allowed to ask that.
..it's really about family and tradition...
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
What are you talking about?
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Do I?
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Nope.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
To me Hollywood is about death.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Hmm.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
I can see nothing's changed.
Why would the police come to you?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You're not a detective.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
What's your point?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Are you saying she was-
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Hello.
W-what do you want?
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Yeah?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
What are you doing here?
Close call.
Now that it's out of your system.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
You heard me.
Who is this?
I want to talk to you for a second.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Guess.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
That's not what you said.
I have to go now.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Gotta go.
I told you not to hang up on me.
Where are you?
No it's not. It was Jason.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
...leave me alone... please...
What?
What kind of lead?
Can I bring Kenny?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What are you doing here?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Any word on my Dad?
Yeah.
That fish smelled strong.
What's the plan?
Just stay back.
You owe my mother.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Where do you get this shit?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Are you alone in the house?
Can you see me right now?
LEAVEMEALONE!
You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
What's Leatherface doing here?
Wanna another beer?
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
They think it's school-related?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
It's none of my business anymore.
What are you talking about?
Where was the girl?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
You know that's not true.
You just met me.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
Who said this was murder?
No one yet.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Well?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Did you read them?
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Nothing.
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
We don't know for sure...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
Kiss me on the lips.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
What?
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
How long have you lived here?
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Crime of passion.
Let's get along...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
I say NO!
Sir?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Yes, sir.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Easy on that!
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
What you goin' to do?
Good night...Laurie...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Lemme alone...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Do you have a better idea?
So do I, believe me.
Where have you been?
What?
She was old.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
Do I look like it that much?
We should leave the past alone.
Tenth floor.
You did not like the speech?
Oh…what have I done?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Will it restore my gift?
I have a wonderful new play!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
it will be all right, madam.
She is always Aphrodite.
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Who wrote that?
By God, I wish I knew.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
This is a different one.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"Madam!"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I am.
Even your play.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, Will!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
I do not love you, my lord.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
No, sir.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Just serve.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
No.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
I just thought we should discuss it.
What's the problem?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
That's it, then.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Cameron.
Yes.
Did you know --
She hated you --
Well, she had problems --
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
You see, they don't really know me.
David hasn't seen him either.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Now?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Oh, good.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you know many of these people?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
It wasn't like that.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Eh --
I'm not sure --
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
What do you do?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
A certain weakness.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
What?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Why not?
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't want to see you anymore.
I don't want to talk about it...
I hope she's all right.
But aren't you...
... what?...
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
... just, you could look very heavy...
How is she?
You promised you'd do the show.
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Yeah?
Yeah, baby...
You were great.
-- ass and legs --
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What's that supposed to mean?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Wash her.
What with?
Otis is dead.
-- how did you get here?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Going where?
No, but I think they might.
What do you want?
When?
When I get off work.
When is that, George?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
Didn't you, baby?
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
I wish you'd go now.
That's all you've got to say?
-- yes.
Did you?
Stop it.
No.
You need a cut.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
But what?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
What, do you think I planned it?
I wanna hear it from you!
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
No thanks.
Yes I do.
No.
You're home.
Yeah.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Steve?
Then you were talking to him.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jackie, what're you doing?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Don't be silly.
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- I'll get in the back --
Do you have something against traveling?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Dad?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
What about Room 237?
Danny?
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Please...
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
How did he manage to do that?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
She eh... interferes.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
I did?
Sure is.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Get him out of here?
Very nice to meet you.
Well...
Not for me.
Well, obviously some people can be
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Royalty?
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Sure, Uncle Al.
What's the money for?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Rattling. Rustling.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
What is it?
You want to know what I think?
I told you!
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
SING!
Oh-huh.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Why?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Just about.  Show me again.
That machine.
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Pay attention...
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
JUST SING!
You have to help me
She won't?  Why not?
Bobs
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
What did He say?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
What? 
Are you talking about me?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Oh?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
He didn't do you a favor.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I've got to go.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Right.
She's gettin' away!
Sister Mary Patrick?
Peace on Earth.
We both missed.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
They spend two days in chains.
What is that?
Bring Young Masbath here.
What?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
Where are we going?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Thank you.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
What now?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
My suitor?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
To avenge his father, and the others.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
The church.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Can I help you?
Did you decide, sir?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
They was a boy. We made friends.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
What are all them books?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
How did your mama die?
Two people.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Naw.
Why not? It died?
So it died when it come out?
A little ol' boy.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
I've got a feelin' today.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
You all right, Mama?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
You better go get your things.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I want to come back and stay here.
Do they know about you?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Yes sir.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Is he leaving right this minute?
I didn't mean that.
Will he be supervised?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Yeah, I did.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Yeah, probably.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
I mean, it's a good story.
You're looking good, Auggie.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
You don't give up, do you?
Where to?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Huh?
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
The refrigerator?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And you told your nephew about it?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
It was just a thought.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
So what's the time?
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You don't really want to know.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Good thinking.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
No wonder he was angry.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'm not going to do it.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Oh, yeh?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
And the next one...?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Well...
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
No --- how does it go?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
We're not?
I thought you weren't talking to me.
With you.
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
You mean it's a girls' band?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
They got the bull-fiddle.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
WHAT?
Like what?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Joe -
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Stay as long as you'd like.
You all right?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
I may spill something.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
What do you think you're doing?
But there's one thing I envy you for.
His yacht?
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Yes, Joe.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
Where did he conduct?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Really?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Why?
Who are you?
Which one is yours - the big one?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
You heard her - yes.
Three?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
Talk about sad.
I never knew it could be like this.
Mineral baths - now really!
Good night.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Did you have a nice time?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Coffee?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
I never join nothin'.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
Why wouldn't I?
You know what I love about all this?
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Pub Golf?
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
What?
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
So, what’s your point?
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Mmm.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Why?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
What is?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Are you asking me if I’m gay for pay?
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Hi, kiddo.
You don't live around here, do you?
What about Sounder?
But where is my daddy!?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
It was too dark, Daddy.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where was you, Daddy?
You bet we is!
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Where did it come from, Mama?
You got two shirts on?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Did you see Daddy?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Any sign of Sounder?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Hello, David...
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
Little chilly.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Well, let's get to work!
Pillow.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Suck my balls.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
Your behind?
Mph rmph rm!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
What?
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Dude, we don't have watches.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
How can they do this?
This is sweet!!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Oh dear God...
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Shiteater-
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
I'm needing lunch.
Oh.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Oh Sara...
It can't be.
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
On channel 10?
What did you say to me?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
That's right.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
We don't.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Are you ready?
You're ready for the real thing?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Do you want some advice?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
And what are you going to do?!
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
I'm going back for Taylor!
I guess so.
I'm looking for a man.
Find your bowler?
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
I got a right. You're my father.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
You got a better offer?
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Cool!
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Who's there?
Junior who?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
What if he wants to get out?
Where's Junior?
Look who's talking!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
What's your specialty?
Do you know where they're taking him?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a boyfriend?
So, what about you?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Do you talk with your mom?
You got any broken bones?
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
I feel sick.
Are you sure he's dead?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
It's burning...
Wait a minute --
But she's --
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
That's our reserve air.
Norman, please!  Don't!
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
What is it, Norman?
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
I see it.
Well, where the fuck is he?
It's chipped.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
What's wrong?
Sir, about leaving --
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What sub?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
The library.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Beth --
Forget the sub.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Manifested?
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Antihistamine.  For bites.
It's like a sleeping pill?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
For what?
What's wrong, Norman?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
You're insane.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Then where's it coming from?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who?  The fish?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
Like what?  I'm not --
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Wisconsin's your answer.
The three of us.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
English?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
How are the others?
What was that, sir?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
Who's everyone?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Well, we'll see...
The Empire must have gotten here first.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Is that good or bad?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Who are you anyway?
I know that.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
You mean we should go after her!...
The Kiber Crystal.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
I'll make a report later.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, no, sir.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Well, whad'ya know...
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Where are you going ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Who ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Why not ?
How do I know if this is love ?
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
I can't help it.
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
No thanks, Diz.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
What's that, Diz ?
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
What frequency ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Who is V'ger?
<U>Answer</U>!
By the Creator.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You saved the ship.
Granted.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
It's taken control of the computer...!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
'Commander' Decker?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
And whatever you sensed out here....
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
The point... 
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
You quit.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
That's true.  You grow up here?
...who...?
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You'd know better'n me.
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
I...
Uh huh.
Fix my glasses.
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Oh, God...
Hi.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
You know what else a man can do?
Now you're talking...
What am I gonna do?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What is it, a surprise?
I wasn't doing business.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Wat...
I will.
Fifteen hands.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Isn't he...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Her...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Aren't you ever in school?
The Mayor's outside.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Nobody.
No.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Look.
Who is that...?
Oh.
Yeah.
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
I...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Doug...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I'm very sorry I...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I don't drink.
No.
I didn't say anything to them.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
She coulda done better than him.
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
I hate when you say that.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
So why are you asking me?
Look she's upset --
Not with my mouth open.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
This is my house too!
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Why don't you say hello?
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
No.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I'm fine, ba...
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Rache says it's from you.
And when did that pass?
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
Something's up wi...
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's a huge moment in their life --
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
You WHAT?
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Moi?
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Is that what he told you?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
They're my kids.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Out! Leave the table!
You heard me: leave the table!
Yes.
Must've been hard being poor.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Who is Jesus?
Oh. How did it happen?
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
Sure!...
Huh?
The same. Same as what?
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
...gger.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
I believe it.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You know...I like you.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Prnceton.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
I'll lead.
Forget about it.
What do you mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What do you think?
Are the labs in operation?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
She's as good as gone...
And what exactly do they intend to do?
How goes the roll call?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Don't be ridiculous.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
So what?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
What did you say?
Well, Mister President.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
How long will it take to receive them all?
Call them every five miles.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Master safety.
Primary bomb is live.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Yes, Major.
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead, all right.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But I get a red light.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Sure.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
I know, man.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Hey, man.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
You better! Yes!
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Will you stand up for me?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
He is.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Oh, yeah?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Yeah?
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
What?
Seven-twenty.
You could've come over.
Your sure as hell right about that.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
I would've stopped it.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
And?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
'Bye, Jeff.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So you think I should?
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yep.
Yeah.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
It's none of my business?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Spit from your dad?
Kansas!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Hello?
Bullets.
You want us to help you pick up?
Is that you down there?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
In a deep freeze.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
I had a teacher like that once.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
We're engaged.
It's just impossible.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
And you'll play Salome?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Of course it is.
I wrote that with my heart.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Madame is waiting.
Good.
The doctor suggested it.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
How's that about your being my friend?
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount studios.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What does it mean?
Eliminate her.
Home?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
We can't do that.
We're from different worlds.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
Away. From you.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
What is it?
And you think you're in love.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I'd rather not talk about it.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
She did that deliberately.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
It doesn't seem right.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You're wasting your breath.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
You're going to take me back?
Mr. Roebush?
Tuesday.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Call me.
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Say what?
Man, what is this?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Everything.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I know, by computers.
Who is she?
What about you?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
The picture looks blurry.
What terrific story?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Today coffee----
Where did it come from?
A normal person.
I don't?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Maybe I could try --
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
A "complimentary corsage."
I didn't think I wanted to.
We'd better talk.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Let's go to my place.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
. . . Superman?. . . . .
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Good. My heart can't take it.
This way Lex.
Wrong.
I think he said a "curl."
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
Now This I want to hear.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
DELETE IN CUTTING
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
You are master of all you survey.
I really don't think . . .
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Impossible? Why?
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I think there's an angle.
An angle?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
We'll all fry.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Albert!
Lois isn't here?
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Jealous? Of what?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
This??
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
What do you suggest, my dear?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
How good it felt!
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Superman???
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Is that real enough for you?
What is this??!
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I'm...so sorry.
What happened?
Alison.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Case?
Hi, Nicole.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
It does concern me.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Because I have to.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
From what?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Berries.
And what's that?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
Yes.  He does.
What other people?
Anything you didn't understand?
Away from your crazy Mom.
What happened to summer?
And winter?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Dolores.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
I have no questions.
That's the local bar?
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Perfect.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
Yes.
I tested positive.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
What is it?
Dolores?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Are you expensive?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Why were you scared?
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
What's so funny?
The ramp?
The door needs a lock.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Come on boys, break it up...
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
No...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
I know Manny Davis.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Get Steve back his job...please...
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Sidney, I told you -
I don't think so.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
I know you do, Sidney.
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I didn't do anything!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
You have to do what I say?!
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Why do you cry?
Pain causes it?
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
It must end here... or I am the future.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
No shit?
No!  Don't kill him!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Mom?  You okay?
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
Why him?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Not yet.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Yes.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
This is absolute nonsense!
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Helmuth.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
One of your people told me.
Sure.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Anything else?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
You must have a girlfriend.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
Reese...you got a first name?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Thanks a lot.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
And who was the enemy?
I can help you...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Call her.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Now, look...
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Oh, God... !
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Right.  Call me Christy.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
Wha... ?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Stop it!
I have to get to the airport...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Tell me where we're going.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
You dodged a bullet.
How do you know?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Yes.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
What kind of vacation?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Hey... !
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
Luke, can I talk to you?
And those are Luke's and mine.
It's not going to hold your weight.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Well, this lot is full!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
And then what happened?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I don't know.
Come on.
You know what he's really upset about?
How'd I know it was for you?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Jeez.
Yes.  I've missed it.
David.
I've never had a pedicure before.
Nell, what happened?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
We think someone is here.
How they goin', kid?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
What kind?
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You broke last time.
Oh really?  Where you from?
I didn't expect anyone.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Not me, man.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
You goin' back inside?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
That would be too easy.
What post office?
You just cooking then?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
He give me your address.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Something like that, yeah.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
So what's your beef, pal?
All of what?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Something's on.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
What's in it?
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
Is Valentine here?
Hello there.
Thanks.  You, too.
Tell me.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
We've certainly missed you.
Oh, Mr Crane--
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Ah... it's nothing.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Birdy--
...You are ze fahzer?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
How much to they want, Dave?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Should I... should I tell you why?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
I'm fine. Thanks.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...Ed?
This hair.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Mr...?
We're just closing, friend.
Not an owner.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Uh... you're under arrest.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
It better be good.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I don't want to scare people.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
What doors?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What happened?!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
What's that?
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
What are we talking about here?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Oh... my... God!
How about lunch?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
That's not what I saw.
Genetic damage?
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
I have to shoot.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why is he in the basement?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
All prop cars accounted for?
--a dead one at that.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Are we talking Emmies?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
The creator of what?
Nothing was real.
I have a map.
No...I, er.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
I've got to talk to you.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
How about them?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
What's that?
What's that?
I won't be late.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
It looks so small.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
They're coming.  Any minute.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
How's it going, Truman?
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
What am I doing here?
I need your clothes, Byers.
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
No, they don't.
You've got something to show me.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
How can this be?
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
Have you examined them?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Those people were already dead.
You know my work?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
You found something?
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I'm on the roof.
No. I haven't.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
How's that?
Had you.
Scully...
Something's not right...
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Get dressed, Scully.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What did you find?
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
And you've never seen anything like that?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
It may be extraterrestrial.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Mr. Mulder.
Why are you telling me this?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Is it cold in here?
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What then?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
You think you can do this, don't you?
Evil.
You're sure of that?
They're hungry.
Oh no... No you don't.
Agent Cole.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
What about narcotics?
How's the patient.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't have to.
...at all.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
H-E-Z-T...
...to steal my girl.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
...again.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
That's his headache.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
They'll be returned, miss.
What is it?
Been here long?
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Listen, Callaghan.
Getting around, Martins.
So would I.
...of Santa Fe."
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Do you know his number?
Never heard of him.
Yes.
You told them, didn't you?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Coming to the point, please.
Find out?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
Mr. Martins...
Passport, please.
Where are you staying?
Okay.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
What!
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
I'm sorry.
He tried to borrow money from us.
It's on an island that no one get to.
One kilometer
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So?
Fucking Danny, man...
You coming?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
The sex is better.
What's it about?
Don't curse in front of it.
You shouldn't.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
That's a much easier game.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
They're liars and cowards.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Of course they're Jews.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I thought you hated Torah.
You do it on the inside....
From the Rhineland originally.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
A Jewish prayer.
Shut up. Fuck you....
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
Where?
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Why me?
How did you know they were Jews?
What?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
You're leaving?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
Did the driver really freeze?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
No!
You're right.  You're fired.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
What was he like, when he was little?
And just where are you from?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
Enzo, wake up!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
Well, what are they?
That's good.
People say that?
Why?
Everything about what?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Yes.
He doesn't like us.
I'm concentrating.
A drink to warm up?
I don't know... why?
You look adorable.
You jumped in?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
I got fired.
I'm still here.
No... tell me.
I didn't dive.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Uncle Louis!
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Again?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Well?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Why is he doing this?
Wait!  Professor...?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's your first move?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
What was that!?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
What's wrong with him?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Who?
Don't look at it!
What, senorita?
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
It's better you don't know.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
That's easy. Me.
No —— not yet.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I got into a little crap game.
We stood here once before.
I know -- Teresa -—
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
That’s right.
Will you please come with me?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
I found this at your brother’s.
Disney! How inter...
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
You lost my money?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Where is that?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
To get me killed...?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Crow what?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
A criminal?
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Where is he?
Where are we?
And who does Friedman work for?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Should I?
May I...?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
My rates...
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Let’s go.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
I know his work better than I know him.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
What's going on?!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
No, but...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
I can't read.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Scared of a girl?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You will??
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... You look wonderful...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
I know...
For what?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
Clear?
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Yeah...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Who gave you that horse?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
What signs?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
"Love your enemies"...
Yes...
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Oh yes... very.
Someone you know?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Halina?
What?
wish I knew you better.
I haven't seen him.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
I know.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Yes, so did the Germans.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
What's all that gunfire?
Yes, like a cave.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
I worry for you.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You don't want to learn.
You've missed this bit.
You the owner here?
That's right.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
What's the line on Visitation?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
What do we do?
You got a bag or somethin?
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
You just worry about your end, kid.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
No.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
I guess I left it in my room.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
So could Shaw.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
No.
What happened to your face?
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Cheer up, darling.
Mind if I look around?
And don't ever try to see me again.
Yes.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
This is my wedding.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Where are you going?
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Not at all.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'll have to try to remember.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
What do you mean?
Could this be him?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
But he's interested!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Where's Gilbert?
But he has nothing to do with it!
You did... where?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Perfectly absurd.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
I didn't knock Julia off.
Why tell me?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
What am I?  The fall guy?
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Want a drink?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
He's just been for a walk.
Smart gal.
Yes!
I wish you'd tell me who.
You're going to drive me crazy!
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
You his wife?
What's it say?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
What?
They stopped.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
Maybe we should split it up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Wes--
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Invest it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
It'd make their heads explode.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Where you going?
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
How's this going to work?
It's a fire fight.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Jesus, Jaeger.
What the hell took so long.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do you make of them?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Well?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Yeah.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
A headache?
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
How long we going to keep this up.
It's got a bottom.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
I have to... he's a G-34
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Are you all right?
no...no, no.
There goes another of your disciples.
I thought you were through with it!
We're leaving.
Why did you have LUH come here?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Which way?
I don't know.
What was that....
That's not it.
You don't know that!
Yes.
Yes...
Officer Reilly, vice.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
This is where the van was parked.
Yep.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
You guys seem pretty tight.
More metal... sharp edge...
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Then why tell me?
What is that?
Alex, please-
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Mike...
Device.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
What did you talk about?
No.
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
And harems ... ?
Smart. London, eh?
Just dull.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Who?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
The pepper, too?
Gaston Monescu.
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Ah!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
But, Lily--
Lily-- 
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
You know the main staircase in the opera?
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
What?
Yes!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Yes, madame?
Together.
Beautiful.
Any minute I want!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Yes--uh--
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
He started it.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
You're certain?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Rose Calvert.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
But I was with him the whole time.
Almost as good as you.
And these were drawn from life?
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Sure. If you like.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
You're trembling.
You have to go for help.
I'm not going without you.
April 14, 1912.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
You think she was really there?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
It's been 84 years...
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
How'd you ever get away with it?
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Never eat before the show.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Don't rub it in.
Sooner it you like.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
What, again?
How well do you know her?
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Come in! 
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Sure.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Very serious?
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
With your dry wit and humor--
Well, he has a straw hat--
--And he has sex appeal.
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
About twelve hundred.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
No!
That's the truth--every single word!
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Listen, I want to talk to you.
I don't understand.
Beauty, ain't he?
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
You don't even know him.
What's wrong, Doc?
How you feeling, Doc?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Then what do I do?
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I laugh sometimes
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Mattie.  What about this?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
Forget it, Ringo.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
What'd you do that for?
There they are.  No herd though.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Where can I find him?
- We all want what we can't have?
What - no lust for adventure?
Wait a minute -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
His newspapers?
Gone fishing.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
Why don't we just take these -
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Blood or Dutch?
Wait here.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
... What's Harmsway done?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
What about ID's?
Will it go off?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Like muddy waters?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
How is the garden doing?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
You invited me.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Where is Skip?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
How are you?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Right here in the van.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
We're almost there.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
According to my nava-computer, the --
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
But why would Andy want me?
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Something's screwy here.
What?
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Who is it this time?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Toss 'im overboard!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Sir!  No Sir!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
This is ludicrous.
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
He's a pyjama case, really.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
You're only a young thing.
Stop it!
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Why does he need money?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Just watching you.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
You can't make me.
Yes.
What is this, like freebase?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
Are you getting this on tape?
Arizona.
You may speak.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You're breaking my heart.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
You first.
You will help me with my other problem.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Madrigal's alive.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
My work keeps me young.
Noriega is a criminal.
What do you look for?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
She's not at that place you sent her?
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Did you tell him?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Can you not go yourself.
Jesus.
I'd fucking kill you.
Out.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Are you getting out much?
No.
No.
Running time?
Screenwriter?
Roald Dahl.
So who else?
Despite the Academy award?
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
When are you going to visit him?
Fuck you.
I can't believe you did that.
Why?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Yeah.
It's fresh air.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
No, no, it's not possible.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
But how?
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
I could use a shower.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Who is it he reminds you of?
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
What is this?
Spock?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Now learn something about yourself.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...


No. I will not.
Each man's pain is unique.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Your old files -- ?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
Yes!
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
If you think -
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Well I want to communicate --
Hah.
Well, isn't it -- ?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
A User -- in our world?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
There's another beam!
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
How 'bout yourself?
Watch it!
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
But-what if I can't...?
New guy...
Why is everything...like this?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Son of a bitch!
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Helen's going to be pissed.
It can't be.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
My husband is a good man.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
They said you had to run out.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
What?
As much as you used to?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
What are you going to do?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
What's going on, Harry?
I understand.
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
I'm married!
We're going to Paris?
It's a good thing you pay me well.
What do you want me to do?
How?
Gotten your mail yet?
Not yet.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What do you want to know?
Ask me them again. One by one.
What's your favorite movie star?
Burt Reynolds.
"Heroes For Sale"?
You have a pimp?
Is he nice?
I don't believe so.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Is this a joke?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Cancoon.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
No thanks.
You're really in love, aren't you?
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
Clarence.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Look, Dick, I don't -
What department?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Say it, goddamn it!
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
What makes you think I would do that?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Who is he?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
No.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I've seen him.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
What about him?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Could we try it now?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Preach on, Big D.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Sorta room-mates?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
They forced me to take drugs.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
It's so clean.  No germs.
July.
What year do you think it is?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
It's just a shot to calm you.
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
What made you think that?
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You... you couldn't have heard me.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
You really want to know?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Nothing.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
You want somethin'?
What time is it now?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
No charge.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
What do you want?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Maybe I don't want you to.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Where you coming from?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Games?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
What about him?
Where are you going?
Not me.  Us.
Give him the money.
I shot him.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
John, throw me the keys.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Someone will find me.
I'm a solid man.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
You think that's a lot of money?
All I have in the world.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Jake--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
What happened to your hand?
Oz.
For what?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
How old are you?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
They're not very imaginative?
Now, what's this?
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Got any cold soda?
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You meant it.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
Next time you'll do just fine.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Cause she's dead.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Yep.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
You sure you can manage?
Wasn't nothing.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Where you headed?
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
A medicine man?
You know what I want.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
But I thought --
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Why's that?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
But, in particular?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Once again please?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Okay.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
In college. A car accident.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
That's not what I witnessed David.
He's doing well today.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
He's kind of a miracle.
What's he look like?
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
No.
How much did you take off?
What do you do if something happens?
I'm sleeping in my room.
I see.
Know what?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
I fined 'em instead.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
What'd he say?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Your wife?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Alive?
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
And?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
I can't see 'em.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Well, she...
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Shit.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Who said that?
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Far enough.
Yeah.
How many you killed, Kid?
His pistol must of jammed.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Yeah.
There was ninety-one million -
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They just said they wanted time.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
You have to come.
Tough break.
Three million?
What is this?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
How are you, Keaton?
Ready?
Who's your boss?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
What did you say?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
He loved her.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
Because he was my friend.
Edie...
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
I'm fine.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
... tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Yes.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Yes.
That's right.
Yes.
Yes!
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
I'm on the staff of...
It's a crime.
Yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
'Code Blue'...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I read the hospital report on your client.
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I object, your Honor...
How come you're calling me from...?
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
Why?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
I...
You, you don't under...
No.
He's not in, Sir.
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
Hi, Mickey ...
...I'm going to need your help...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
What?
Admittance form is wrong.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... I understand ...
Yes.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
What did she say?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
How long have you been back?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Yes.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
And when she goes to those places...
Hello.
Did she hurt herself?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Just let me talk to you.
You.
What do you want to know?
Judy Barton.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Scottie, what are you doing?
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Ah, no!
No, Ernie's is fine.
How does it work?
I need you.
Scottie --
Take me away...
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.
Where had you been before?
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
-- talking to you...
I don't like them.
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
Yes...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
And it's a all real.
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Would you please go and look?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Three whole weeks.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
Yeah.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Yes! That's it!
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
The stripper's here.
Can't do what?
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
Just stop.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Later.
I know...
What.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
Money?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
What is it?
She's not here.
So who's the lucky guy?
He's right.
You said that Boyd.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
I'm talking about prayer.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Say it again.
Yeah.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Nope.
What's your point?
What?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
I think so.
Yes.
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Right before the wedding?
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Keith do not trivialize this.
So what do we do?
We're leaving in three hours.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
I'm working on it.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
No...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
Okay great. What will that be?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, the children sleep with me.
Enedina and Paco ...
Was that difficult to get?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
You must think I am a monster.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
What are you thinking about?
You see how much you like her?
Me, rich? Come on!
Well... is it so urgent?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
And ...your friend?
How are you today?
Things seem to be getting better.
He came in through the cupboard.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Hello.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
I've seen worse.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Think you can do it?
What happens if I can't catch him?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
What the hell happened?
I'm still making adjustments...
What's wrong with Parker?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
SID —— NO!!!
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
What does that mean?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
You know I am.
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
My guess is dead.
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
Where's John?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
...can we have a white one...?
...where?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
<u>Do</u> it...
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Yes
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Yes.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
...uh huh...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
...fourteen years...
Oh, Lord....
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
Quite touching.
...where is my pill?
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
My name is Ronald Brean.
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
"Freedom."
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
No.  You're right.
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
Better.
...by you?
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
...gimme some help...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
...Work okay?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
What are you doing here?
...thanks Natalie.
What if they call him?
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Yeah, right...
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
What the hell do you want?
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Do you think you're ready?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Hi.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
About what?  About us.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
We're all here, and ready sir!
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
That was very good.
Fine.
No.
You were in an accident?
How're you holding up?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Who?  Your husband?
Tell me.  Please.
I've never even met you.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Mrs. Frank?
I don't know.
I came in from my room...
Yep.
You think he killed her?
Seance.
Jody, no...
I have to go.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Okay.  Okay.
I was down in Adamant...
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
I don't know.
I know.
When's she out of here?
I am, really.
Not the focus.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Why?
I know.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Unless you need me to come home...
Claire?
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call the police?
Think I may have cracked it.
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Get down!  He'll see.
A flare?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Dressed?
...like it never even happened...
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
It's too rough.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I tried to break it off!
She can't be here without me.
The leaves...
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Shhhh.
:Well, they are.
Then what is he...?
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I had you sent away.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I don't want the -
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
uh - then he - be just -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
It is from love.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
I LOVE him!
I know that you're evil.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
No!
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
They like you ------- kids.
Just one.  The bar's closed.
you're very --- different.
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Rowan...?
Do you love me, Michael...?
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Mm-hmmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
No.    This is unreal...
That's cause we're below sea level.
You alright...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Which do you think is her best shot...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I lost the touch
Where do you kill them...
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Tell me about your wife...
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
STEPHANIE?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Sugar?
See? Did you see that?
Were you always this sick?
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Take a whiff of heaven.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Yeah?
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
Which you pulled, hard!
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
The lesson being?
I guess.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Sorry I--
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
The one with the horses.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
What do you want me to do?
Well?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
If you could just sign right there.
Great.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
I have absolutely no intention--
Your article sucked.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I guess.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You're amazing.
He's on the move?
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Come on.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
As much as possible.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Me? The King of Coitus?
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
In a hurry, are we?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
No.
Maybe she used another name.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
What was that?
Why?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
This wasn't my idea.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I say something funny?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
You are.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Excuse me?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't forget the car wash.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
And you believe her?
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
But check this...
What's that supposed to mean?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
There's nothing for them to get.
Come on, let loose!
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
No.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
What?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Limestone quarry?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Now, what was that?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Jim, are you all right?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Oh, thank you.
My hat is off to you, sir.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You bring the best out in a man.
Your private train, sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Hey...!
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Fresh goat's milk.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
No!
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Yeah.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
What was that?
We do not go into your courts.
But why would they murder...
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Yes.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Aunt Em!
From now on you'll be history
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Run, Toto, run!
Are you ready now?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Uh-huh.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Now you're seeing reason.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh - I'll get it!
What sort of an animal is that?
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Dorothy!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
A home --
How about a hippopotamus?
Oh, come on.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Did they hurtcha?
Oh, now I'll never get home!
I have so got brains.
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
He said his mouth.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Fine.  He's got a plan
I haven't slept in weeks.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
... about Dorothy.
...junk!
To Oz?
Hey, Dorothy!
Yes.
Oh - look out.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Well --
What happened to Len Tashka?
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
What the hell are you talking about?
Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I took the initiative.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Who is it?
Yes.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
So you killed your father.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
I’ll send someone out.
Your father...
He was a...good lover?
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Would you like me to stay?
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
What is it?  How does it work?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
-- What is it.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
What are you up to?
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
What was he doing?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
We should get back --  What?
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
What about you?
New information.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Thanks.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
The scum of the Earth.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Whatchu doing here?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
I was invited. What's your story?
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Anything else I can get you?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
By reading my thoughts?
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
To find Rogue.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
I lost him.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Oh, nice.
Whatever makes you happy.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
I suppose you're right.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
There seem to be quite a few books.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Yes, sir.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
I thought you wanted to.
Aye-gor!
Did you see anyone else down here?
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
What monster?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
May I see your violin?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Oh, Doctor!
Good night, Doctor.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
No, not sound.
Look how far we've come.
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Do you have a reservation?
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
